        <item>The fruit of virtue need not be described in books; it may be inferred from seeing the bearer of a palanquin and the rider therein</item>
        <item>If one allows no day to pass without some good being done, his conduct will be a stone to block up the passage to other births</item>

        <item>Love begets desire: and that (desire) begets the immeasureable excellence of friendship</item>
        <item>These are the fruits of tranquil life of love</item>
        <item>The ignorant say that love is an ally to virtue only, but it is also a help to get out of vice</item>
        <item>Virtue will burn up the soul which is without love, even as the sun burns up the creature which is without bone, ie worms</item>
        <item>The domestic state of that man whose mind is without love is like the flourishing of a withered tree upon the parched desert</item>
        <item>Of what avail are all the external members (of the body) to those who are destitute of love, the internal member</item>
        <item>That body alone which is inspired with love contains a living soul: if void of it, (the body) is bone overlaid with skin</item>
        <item>The whole design of living in the domestic state and laying up (property) is (to be able) to exercise the benevolence of hospitality</item>
        <item>It is not fit that one should wish his guests to be outside (his house) even though he were eating the food of immortality</item>
        <item>The domestic life of the man that daily entertains the guests who come to him shall not be laid waste by poverty</item>
        <item>Lakshmi with joyous mind shall dwell in the house of that man who, with cheerful countenance, entertains the good as guests</item>
        <item>Is it necessary to sow the field of the man who, having feasted his guests, eats what may remain ?</item>
        <item>He who, having entertained the guests that have come, looks out for others who may yet come, will be a welcome guest to the inhabitants of heaven</item>
        <item>The advantages of benevolence cannot be measured; the measure (of the virtue) of the guests (entertained) is the only measure</item>
        <item>Those who have taken no part in the benevolence of hospitality shall (at length lament) saying, "we have laboured and laid up wealth and are now without support."</item>
        <item>That stupidity which excercises no hospitality is poverty in the midst of wealth It is the property of the stupid</item>
        <item>As the Anicham flower fades in smelling, so fades the guest when the face is turned away</item>
        <item>Sweet words are those which imbued with love and free from deceit flow from the mouth of the virtuous</item>
        <item>Sweet speech, with a cheerful countenance is better than a gift made with a joyous mind</item>
        <item>Sweet speech, flowing from the heart (uttered) with a cheerful countenance and a sweet look, is true virtue</item>
        <item>Sorrow-increasing poverty shall not come upon those who use towards all, pleasure-increasing sweetness of speech</item>
        <item>Humility and sweetness of speech are the ornaments of man; all others are not (ornaments)</item>
        <item>If a man, while seeking to speak usefully, speaks also sweetly, his sins will diminish and his virtue increase</item>
        <item>That speech which, while imparting benefits ceases not to please, will yield righteousness (for this world) and merit (for the next world)</item>
        <item>Sweet speech, free from harm to others, will give pleasure both in this world and in the next</item>
        <item>Why does he use harsh words, who sees the pleasure which sweet speech yields ?</item>
        <item>To say disagreeable things when agreeable are at hand is like eating unripe fruit when there is ripe</item>
        <item>(The gift of) heaven and earth is not an equivalent for a benefit which is conferred where none had been received</item>
        <item>A favour conferred in the time of need, though it be small (in itself), is (in value) much larger than the world</item>
        <item>If we weigh the excellence of a benefit which is conferred without weighing the return, it is larger than the sea</item>
        <item>Though the benefit conferred be as small as a millet seed, those who know its advantage will consider it as large as a palmyra fruit</item>
        <item>The benefit itself is not the measure of the benefit; the worth of those who have received it is its measure</item>
        <item>Forsake not the friendship of those who have been your staff in adversity Forget not be benevolence of the blameless</item>
        <item>(The wise) will remember throughout their seven-fold births the love of those who have wiped away their affliction</item>
        <item>It is not good to forget a benefit; it is good to forget an injury even in the very moment (in which it is inflicted)</item>
        <item>Though one inflict an injury great as murder, it will perish before the thought of one benefit (formerly) conferred</item>
        <item>He who has killed every virtue may yet escape; there is no escape for him who has killed a benefit</item>
        <item>That equity which consists in acting with equal regard to each of (the three) divisions of men [enemies, strangers and friends] is a pre-eminent virtue</item>
        <item>The wealth of the man of rectitude will not perish, but will bring happiness also to his posterity</item>
        <item>Forsake in the very moment (of acquisition) that gain which, though it should bring advantage, is without equity</item>
        <item>The worthy and unworthy may be known by the existence or otherwise of good offsprings</item>
        <item>Loss and gain come not without cause; it is the ornament of the wise to preserve evenness of mind (under both)</item>
        <item>Let him whose mind departing from equity commits sin well consider thus within himself, "I shall perish."</item>
        <item>The great will not regard as poverty the low estate of that man who dwells in the virtue of equity</item>
        <item>To incline to neither side, but to rest impartial as the even-fixed scale is the ornament of the wise</item>
        <item>Freedom from obliquity of speech is rectitude, if there be (corresponding) freedom from bias of mind</item>
        <item>The true merchandize of merchants is to guard and do by the things of others as they do by their own</item>
        <item>Self-control will place (a man) among the Gods; the want of it will drive (him) into the thickest darkness (of hell)</item>
        <item>Let self-control be guarded as a treasure; there is no greater source of good for man than that</item>
        <item>Knowing that self-control is knowledge, if a man should control himself, in the prescribed course, such self-control will bring him distinction among the wise</item>
        <item>More lofty than a mountain will be the greatness of that man who without swerving from his domestic state, controls himself</item>
        <item>Humility is good in all; but especially in the rich it is (the excellence of) higher riches</item>
        <item>Should one throughout a single birth, like a tortoise keep in his five senses, the fruit of it will prove a safe-guard to him throughout the seven-fold births.</item>
        <item>Whatever besides you leave unguarded, guard your tongue; otherwise errors of speech and the consequent misery will ensue</item>
        <item>If a man\'s speech be productive of a single evil, all the good by him will be turned into evil</item>
        <item>The wound which has been burnt in by fire may heal, but a wound burnt in by the tongue will never heal</item>
        <item>Virtue, seeking for an opportunity, will come into the path of that man who, possessed of learning and self-control, guards himself against anger</item>
        <item>Propriety of conduct leads to eminence, it should therefore be preserved more carefully than life</item>
        <item>Let propriety of conduct be laboriously preserved and guarded; though one know and practise and excel in many virtues, that will be an eminent aid</item>
        <item>Propriety of conduct is true greatness of birth, and impropriety will sink into a mean birth</item>
        <item>A Brahman though he should forget the Vedas may recover it by reading; but, if he fail in propriety of conduct even his high birth will be destroyed</item>
        <item>Just as the envious man will be without wealth, so will the man of destitute of propriety of conduct be without greatness</item>
        <item>Those firm in mind will not slacken in their observance of the proprieties of life, knowing, as they do, the misery that flows from the transgression from them</item>
        <item>From propriety of conduct men obtain greatness; from impropriety comes insufferable disgrace</item>
        <item>Propriety of conduct is the seed of virtue; impropriety will ever cause sorrow</item>
        <item>Those who study propriety of conduct will not speak evil, even forgetfully</item>
        <item>Those who know not how to act agreeably to the world, though they have learnt many things, are still ignorant</item>
        <item>The folly of desiring her who is the property of another will not be found in those who know (the attributes of) virtue and (the rights of) property</item>
        <item>Among all those who stand on the outside of virtue, there are no greater fools than those who stand outside their neighbour\'s door</item>
        <item>Certainly they are no better than dead men who desire evil towards the wife of those who undoubtingly confide in them</item>
        <item>However great one may be, what does it avail if, without at all considering his guilt, he goes unto the wife of another ?</item>
        <item>He who thinks lightly of going into the wife of another acquires guilt that will abide with him imperishably and for ever</item>
        <item>Hatred, sin, fear, disgrace; these four will never leave him who goes in to his neighbour\'s wife</item>
        <item>He who desires not the womanhood of her who should walk according to the will of another will be praised as a virtuous house-holder</item>
        <item>That noble manliness which looks not at the wife of another is the virtue and dignity of the great</item>
        <item>Is it asked, "who are those who shall obtain good in this world surrounded by the terror-producing sea ?" Those who touch not the shoulder of her who belongs to another.</item>
        <item>Though a man perform no virtuous deeds and commit (every) vice, it will be well if he desire not the womanhood of her who is within the limit (of the house) of another.</item>"
        <item>To bear with those who revile us, just as the earth bears up those who dig it, is the first of virtues.</item>
        <item>Bear with reproach even when you can retaliate; but to forget it will be still better than that.</item>
        <item>To neglect hospitality is poverty of poverty. To bear with the ignorant is might of might.</item>
        <item>If you desire that greatness should never leave, you preserve in your conduct the exercise of patience</item>
        <item>(The wise) will not at all esteem the resentful. They will esteem the patient just as the gold which they lay up with care.</item>
        <item>The pleasure of the resentful continues for a day. The praise of the patient will continue until (the final destruction of) the world.</item>
        <item>Though others inflict injuries on you, yet compassionating the evil (that will come upon them) it will be well not to do them anything contrary to virtue.</item>
        <item>Let a man by patience overcome those who through pride commit excesses.</item>
        <item>Those who bear with the uncourteous speech of the insolent are as pure as the ascetics.</item>
        <item>Those who endure abstinence from food are great, next to those who endure the uncourteous speech of others.</item>
        <item>Let a man esteem that disposition which is free from envy in the same manner as propriety of conduct.</item>
        <item>Amongst all attainable excellences there is none equal to that of being free from envy towords others</item>
        <item>Of him who instead of rejoicing in the wealth of others, envies it, it will be said "he neither desires virtue not wealth".</item>
        <item>(The wise) knowing the misery that comes from transgression will not through envy commit unrighteous deeds.</item>
        <item>To those who cherish envy that is enough. Though free from enemies that (envy) will bring destruction.</item>
        <item>He who is envious at a gift (made to another) will with his relations utterly perish destitute of food and rainment.</item>
        <item>Lakshmi envying (the prosperity) of the envious man will depart and introduce him to her sister.</item>
        <item>Envy will destroy (a man\'s) wealth (in his world) and drive him into the pit of fire (in the world to come).</item>
        <item>The wealth of a man of envious mind and the poverty of the righteous will be pondered.</item>
        <item>Never have the envious become great; never have those who are free from envy been without greatness.</item>
        <item>If a man departing from equity covet the property (of others), at that very time will his family be destroyed and guilt be incurred.</item>
        <item>Those who blush at the want of equity will not commit disgraceful acts through desire of the profit that may be gained.</item>
        <item>Those who desire the higher pleasures (of heaven) will not act unjustly through desire of the trifling joy. (in this life).</item>
        <item>The wise who have conquered their senses and are free from crime, will not covet (the things of others), with the thought "we are destitute".</item>
        <item>What is the advantage of extensive and accurate knowledge if a man through covetousness act senselessly towards all ?.</item>
        <item>If he, who through desire of the virtue of kindness abides in the domestic state i.e., the path in which it may be obtained, covet (the property of others) and think of evil methods (to obtain it), he will perish.</item>
        <item>Desire not the gain of covetousness. In the enjoyment of its fruits there is no glory.</item>
        <item>If it is weighed, "what is the indestructibility of wealth," it is freedom from covetousness.</item>
        <item>Lakshmi, knowing the manner (in which she may approach) will immediately come to those wise men who, knowing that it is virtue, covet not the property of others.</item>
        <item>To covet (the wealth of another) regardless of consequences will bring destruction. That greatness (of mind) which covets not will give victory.</item>
        <item>Though one do not even speak of virtue and live in sin, it will be well if it be said of him "he does not backbite".</item>
        <item>To smile deceitfully (in another\'s presence) after having reviled him to his destruction (behind his back) is a greater evil than the commission of (every other) sin and the destruction of (every) virtue.</item>
        <item>Death rather than life will confer upon the deceitful backbiter the profit which (the treatises on) virtue point out.</item>
        <item>Though you speak without kindness before another\'s face speak not in his absence words which regard not the evil subsequently resulting from it.</item>
        <item>The emptiness of that man\'s mind who (merely) praises virtue will be seen from the meanness of reviling another behind his back.</item>
        <item>The character of the faults of that man who publishes abroad the faults of others will be sought out and published</item>
        <item>Those who know not to live in friendship with amusing conversation will by back-biting estrange even their relatives.</item>
        <item>What will those not do to strangers whose nature leads them to publish abroad the faults of their intimate friends ?.</item>
        <item>The world through charity supports the weight of those who reproach others observing their absence.</item>
        <item>If they observed their own faults as they observe the faults of others, would any evil happen to men ?.</item>
        <item>He who to the disgust of many speaks useless things will be despised by all.</item>
        <item>To speak useless things in the presence of many is a greater evil than to do unkind things towards friends.</item>
        <item>That conversation in which a man utters forth useless things will say of him "he is without virtue".</item>
        <item>The words devoid of profit or pleasure which a man speaks will, being inconsistent with virtue, remove him from goodness.</item>
        <item>If the good speak vain words their eminence and excellence will leave them.</item>
        <item>Call not him a man who parades forth his empty words. Call him the chaff of men.</item>
        <item>Let the wise if they will, speak things without excellence; it will be well for them not to speak useless things.</item>
        <item>The wise who seek after rare pleasures will not speak words that have not much weight in them.</item>
        <item>Those wise men who are without faults and are freed from ignorance will not even forgetfully speak things that profit not.</item>
        <item>Speak what is useful, and speak not useless words.</item>
        <item>Those who have experience of evil deeds will not fear, but the excellent will fear the pride of sin.</item>
        <item>Because evil produces evil, therefore should evil be feared more than fire.</item>
        <item>To do no evil to enemies will be called the chief of all virtues.</item>
        <item>Even though forgetfulness meditate not the ruin of another. Virtue will meditate the ruin of him who thus meditates.</item>
        <item>Commit not evil, saying, "I am poor": if you do, you will become poorer still.</item>
        <item>Let him not do evil to others who desires not that sorrows should pursue him</item>
        <item>However great be the enmity men have incurred they may still live. The enmity of sin will incessantly pursue and kill.</item>
        <item>Destruction will dwell at the heels of those who commit evil even as their shadow that leaves them not.</item>
        <item>If a man love himself, let him not commit any sin however small.</item>
        <item>Know ye that he is freed from destruction who commits no evil, going to neither side of the right path.</item>
        <item>Benevolence seeks not a return. What does the world give back to the clouds ?.</item>
        <item>All the wealth acquired with perseverance by the worthy is for the exercise of benevolence.</item>
        <item>It is difficult to obtain another good equal to benevolence either in this world or in that of the gods.</item>

        <item>The wealth of that man of eminent knowledge who desires to exercise the benevolence approved of by the world, is like the full waters of a city-tank.</item>
        <item>The wealth of a man (possessed of the virtue) of benevolence is like the ripening of a fruitful tree in the midst of a town.</item>
        <item>If wealth be in the possession of a man who has the great excellence (of benevolence), it is like a tree which as a medicine is an infallible cure for disease.</item>
        <item>The wise who know what is duty will not scant their benevolence even when they are without wealth.</item>
        <item>The poverty of a benevolent man, is nothing but his inability to exercise the same.</item>
        <item>If it be said that loss will result from benevolence, such loss is worth being procured even by the sale of one\'s self.</item>
        <item>To give to the destitute is true charity. All other gifts have the nature of (what is done for) a measured return.</item>

        <item>To see men begging from us in disagreeable, until we see their pleasant countenance.</item>
        <item>The power of those who perform penance is the power of enduring hunger. It is inferior to the power of those who remove the hunger (of others).</item>

        <item>The fiery disease of hunger shall never touch him who habitually distributes his food to others.</item>
        <item>Do the hard-eyed who lay up and lose their possessions not know the happiness which springs from the pleasure of giving ?.</item>
        <item>Solitary and unshared eating for the sake of filling up one\'s own riches is certainly much more unpleasant than begging.</item>
        <item>Nothing is more unpleasant than death: yet even that is pleasant where charity cannot be exercised.</item>
        <item>Give to the poor and live with praise. There is no greater profit to man than that.</item>

        <item>If one has acquired extensive fame within the limits of this earth, the world of the Gods will no longer praise those sages who have attained that world.</item>
        <item>Prosperity to the body of fame, resulting in poverty to the body of flesh and the stability to the former arising from the death of the latter, are achievable only by the wise.</item>

        <item>Not to beget fame will be esteemed a disgrace by the wise in this world.</item>

        <item>(The wise) say that the evils, which his soul would dread, will never come upon the man who exercises kindness and protects the life (of other creatures).</item>
        <item>This great rich earth over which the wind blows, is a witness that sorrow never comes upon the kind-hearted.</item>
        <item>(The wise) say that those who neglect kindness and practise cruelties, neglected virtue (in their former birth), and forgot (the sorrows which they must suffer).</item>
        <item>As this world is not for those who are without wealth, so that world is not for those who are without kindness.</item>
        <item>Those who are without wealth may, at some future time, become prosperous; those who are destitute of kindness are utterly destitute; for them there is no change.</item>
        <item>If you consider, the virtue of him who is without kindness is like the perception of the true being by him who is without wisdom.</item>

        <item>As those possess no property who do not take care of it, so those possess no kindness who feed on flesh.</item>
        <item>Like the (murderous) mind of him who carries a weapon (in his hand), the mind of him who feasts with pleasure on the body of another (creature), has no regard for goodness.</item>
        <item>If it be asked what is kindness and what its opposite, the answer would be preservation and destruction of life; and therefore it is not right to feed on the flesh (obtained by taking away life).</item>
        <item>Not to eat flesh contributes to the continuance of life; therefore if a man eat flesh, hell will not open its mouth (to let him escape out, after he has once fallen in).</item>
        <item>If the world does not destroy life for the purpose of eating, then no one would sell flesh for the sake of money.</item>
        <item>If men should come to know that flesh is nothing but the unclean ulcer of a body, let them abstain from eating it.</item>
        <item>The wise, who have freed themselves from mental delusion, will not eat the flesh which has been severed from an animal.</item>
        <item>Not to kill and eat (the flesh of) an animal, is better than the pouring forth of ghee etc., in a thousand sacrifices.</item>
        <item>All creatures will join their hands together, and worship him who has never taken away life, nor eaten flesh.</item>
        <item>The nature of religious discipline consists, in the endurance (by the ascetic) of the sufferings which it brings on himself, and in abstaining from giving pain to others.</item>
        <item>Austerities can only be borne, and their benefits enjoyed, by those who have practised them (in a former birth); it will be useless for those who have not done so, to attempt to practise them (now).</item>
        <item>It is to provide food etc, for the ascetics who have abandoned (the desire of earthly possessions) that other persons have forgotten (to practise) austerity ?.</item>
        <item>If (the ascetic) desire the destruction of his enemies, or the aggrandizement of his friends, it will be effected by (the power of) his austerities.</item>
        <item>Religious dislipline is practised in this world, because it secures the attainment of whatever one may wish to enjoy (in the world to come).</item>
        <item>Those discharge their duty who perform austerities; all others accomplish their own destruction, through the entanglement of the desire (of riches and sensual pleasure).</item>
        <item>Just as gold is purified as heated in the fire, will those shine, who have endured the burning of pain (in frequent austerities).</item>
        <item>All other creatures will worship him who has attained the control of his own soul.</item>
        <item>Those who have attained the power which religious discipline confers, will be able also to pass the limit of Yama, (the God of death).</item>

        <item>The words of the good are like a staff in a slippery place.</item>

        <item>Wisdom is a weapon to ward off destruction; it is an inner fortress which enemies cannot destroy.</item>
        <item>Not to permit the mind to go where it lists, to keep it from evil, and to employ it in good, this is wisdom.</item>
        <item>To discern the truth in every thing, by whomsoever spoken, is wisdom.</item>
        <item>To speak so as that the meaning may easily enter the mind of the hearer, and to discern the subtlest thought which may lie hidden in the words of others, this is wisdom.</item>
        <item>To secure the friendship of the great is true wisdom; it is (also) wisdom to keep (that friendship unchanged, and) not opening and closing (like the lotus flower).</item>
        <item>To live as the world lives, is wisdom.</item>
        <item>The wise are those who know beforehand what will happen; those who do not know this are the unwise.</item>

        <item>To cherish great men and make them his own, is the most difficult of all difficult things.</item>
        <item>So to act as to make those men, his own, who are greater than himself is of all powers the highest.</item>

        <item>There are failures even in acting well, when it is done without knowing the various dispositions of men.</item>

        <item>If they who draw near (to fight) choose a suitable place to approach (their enemy), the latter, will have to relinquish the thought which they once entertained, of conquering them.</item>

        <item>(The king\'s) choice should (fall) on him, who is of good family, who is free from faults, and who has the modesty which fears the wounds (of sin).</item>
        <item>When even men, who have studied the most difficult works, and who are free from faults, are (carefully) examined, it is a rare thing to find them without ignorance.</item>
        <item>Let (a king) consider (a man\'s) good qualities, as well as his faults, and then judge (of his character) by that which prevails.</item>
        <item>A man\'s deeds are the touchstone of his greatness and littleness.</item>
        <item>Let (a king) avoid choosing men who have no relations; such men have no attachment, and therefore have no fear of crime.</item>

        <item>To make choice of one who has not been examined, and to entertain doubts respecting one who has been chosen, will produce irremediable sorrow.</item>
        <item>He should be employed (by a king), whose nature leads him to choose the good, after having weighed both the evil and the good in any undertaking.</item>
        <item>Let him do (the king\'s) work who can enlarge the sources (of revenue), increase wealth and considerately prevent the accidents (which would destroy it).</item>
        <item>Let the choice (of a king) fall upon him who largely possesses these four things, love, knowledge, a clear mind and freedom from covetousness.</item>

        <item>After having considered, "this man can accomplish this, by these means", let (the king) leave with him the discharge of that duty.</item>
        <item>Having considered what work a man is fit for, let (the king) employ him in that work.</item>
        <item>Prosperity will leave (the king) who doubts the friendship of the man who steadily labours in the discharge of his duties.</item>

        <item>Even when (a man\'s) property is all gone, relatives will act towards him with their accustomed (kindness).</item>
        <item>If (a man\'s) relatives remain attached to him with unchanging love, it will be a source of ever-increasing wealth.</item>
        <item>The wealth of one who does not mingle freely with his relatives, will be like the filling of water in a spacious tank that has no banks.</item>
        <item>To live surrounded by relatives, is the advantage to be derived from the acquisition of wealth.</item>
        <item>He will be surrounded by numerous relatives who manifests generosity and affability.</item>

        <item>The crows do not conceal (their prey), but will call out for others (to share with them) while they eat it; wealth will be with those who show a similar disposition (towards their relatives).</item>
        <item>Many relatives will live near a king, when they observe that he does not look on all alike, but that he looks on each man according to his merit.</item>
        <item>Those who have been friends and have afterwards forsaken him, will return and join themselves (to him), when the cause of disagreement is not to be found in him.</item>
        <item>When one may have left him, and for some cause has returned to him, let the king fulfil the object (for which he has come back) and thoughtfully receive him again.</item>
        <item>More evil than excessive anger, is forgetfulness which springs from the intoxication of great joy.</item>
        <item>Forgetfulness will destroy fame, even as constant poverty destroys knowledge.</item>
        <item>Thoughtlessness will never acquire fame; and this tenet is upheld by all treatises in the world.</item>
        <item>Just as the coward has no defence (by whatever fortifications ha may be surrounded), so the thoughtless has no good (whatever advantages he may possess).</item>
        <item>The thoughtless man, who provides not against the calamities that may happen, will afterwards repent for his fault.</item>
        <item>There is nothing comparable with the possession of unfailing thoughtfulness at all times; and towards all persons.</item>
        <item>There is nothing too difficult to be accomplished, if a man set about it carefully, with unflinching endeavour.</item>
        <item>Let (a man) observe and do these things which have been praised (by the wise); if he neglects and fails to perform them, for him there will be no (happiness) throughout the seven births.</item>
        <item>Let (a king) think of those who have been ruined by neglect, when his mind is elated with joy.</item>
        <item>It is easy for (one) to obtain whatever he may think of, if he can again think of it.</item>
        <item>To examine into (the crimes which may be committed), to show no favour (to any one), to desire to act with impartiality towards all, and to inflict (such punishments) as may be wisely resolved on, constitute rectitude.</item>
        <item>When there is rain, the living creation thrives; and so when the king rules justly, his subjects thrive.</item>
        <item>The sceptre of the king is the firm support of the Vedas of the Brahmin, and of all virtues therein described.</item>
        <item>The world will constantly embrace the feet of the great king who rules over his subjects with love.</item>
        <item>Rain and plentiful crops will ever dwell together in the country of the king who sways his sceptre with justice.</item>
        <item>It is not the javelin that gives victory, but the king\'s sceptre, if it do no injustice.</item>
        <item>The king defends the whole world; and justice, when administered without defect, defends the king.</item>
        <item>The king who gives not facile audience (to those who approach him), and who does not examine and pass judgment (on their complaints), will perish in disgrace.</item>
        <item>In guarding his subjects (against injury from others), and in preserving them himself; to punish crime is not a fault in a king, but a duty.</item>
        <item>For a king to punish criminals with death, is like pulling up the weeds in the green corn.</item>
        <item>The king who gives himself up to oppression and acts unjustly (towards his subjects) is more cruel than the man who leads the life of a murderer.</item>
        <item>The request (for money) of him who holds the sceptre is like the word of a highway robber who stands with a weapon in hand and says "give up your wealth".</item>
        <item>The country of the king who does not daily examine into the wrongs done and distribute justice, will daily fall to ruin</item>
        <item>The king, who, without reflecting (on its evil consequences), perverts justice, will lose at once both his wealth and his subjects.</item>
        <item>Will not the tears, shed by a people who cannot endure the oppression which they suffer (from their king), become a saw to waste away his wealth ?.</item>
        <item>Righteous government gives permanence to (the fame of) kings; without that their fame will have no endurance.</item>
        <item>As is the world without rain, so live a people whose king is without kindness.</item>
        <item>Property gives more sorrow than poverty, to those who live under the sceptre of a king without justice.</item>
        <item>If the king acts contrary to justice, rain will become unseasonable, and the heavens will withhold their showers.</item>
        <item>If the guardian (of the country) neglects to guard it, the produce of the cows will fail, and the men of six duties viz., the Brahmins will forget the vedas.</item>
        <item>He is a king who having equitably examined (any injustice which has been brought to his notice), suitably punishes it, so that it may not be again committed.</item>
        <item>Let the king, who desires that his prosperity may long remain, commence his preliminary enquires with strictness, and then punish with mildness.</item>
        <item>The cruel-sceptred king, who acts so as to put his subjects in fear, will certainly and quickly come to ruin.</item>
        <item>The king who is spoken of as cruel will quickly perish; his life becoming shortened.</item>
        <item>The great wealth of him who is difficult of access and possesses a sternness of countenance, is like that which has been obtained by a devil.</item>
        <item>The abundant wealth of the king whose words are harsh and whose looks are void of kindness, will instantly perish instead of abiding long, with him.</item>
        <item>Severe words and excessive punishments will be a file to waste away a king\'s power for destroying (his enemies).</item>
        <item>The prosperity of that king will waste away, who without reflecting (on his affairs himself), commits them to his ministers, and (when a failure occurs) gives way to anger, and rages against them.</item>
        <item>The king who has not provided himself with a place of defence, will in times of war be seized with fear and quickly perish.</item>
        <item>The earth bears up no greater burden than ignorant men whom a cruel sceptre attaches to itself (as the ministers of its evil deeds).</item>
        <item>The world exists through that greatest ornament (of princes), a gracious demeanour.</item>
        <item>The prosperity of the world springs from the kindliness, the existence of those who have no (kindliness) is a burden to the earth.</item>
        <item>Of what avail is a song if it be inconsistent with harmony ? what is the use of eyes which possess no kindliness.</item>
        <item>Beyond appearing to be in the face, what good do they do, those eyes in which is no well-regulated kindness ?.</item>
        <item>Kind looks are the ornaments of the eyes; without these they will be considered (by the wise) to be merely two sores.</item>
        <item>He They resemble the trees of the earth, who although they have eyes, never look kindly (on others).</item>
        <item>Men without kind looks are men without eyes; those who (really) have eyes are also not devoid of kind looks.</item>
        <item>The world is theirs (kings) who are able to show kindness, without injury to their affairs, (administration of justice).</item>
        <item>Patiently to bear with, and show kindness to those who grieve us, is the most excellent of all dispositions.</item>
        <item>Those who desire (to cultivate that degree of) urbanity which all shall love, even after swallowing the poison served to them by their friends, will be friendly with them.</item>
        <item>Let a king consider as his eyes these two things, a spy and a book (of laws) universally esteemed.</item>
        <item>It is the duty of a king to know quickly (by a spy) what all happens, daily, amongst all men.</item>
        <item>There is no way for a king to obtain conquests, who knows not the advantage of discoveries made by a spy.</item>
        <item>He is a spy who watches all men, to wit, those who are in the king\'s employment, his relatives, and his enemies.</item>
        <item>A spy is one who is able to assume an appearance which may create no suspicion (in the minds of others), who fears no man\'s face, and who never reveals (his purpose).</item>
        <item>He is a spy who, assuming the appearance of an ascetic, goes into (whatever place he wishes), examines into (all, that is needful), and never discovers himself, whatever may be done to him.</item>
        <item>A spy is one who is able to discover what is hidden and who retains no doubt concerning what he has known.</item>
        <item>Let not a king receive the information which a spy has discovered and made known to him, until he has examined it by another spy.</item>
        <item>Let a king employ spies so that one may have no knowledge of the other; and when the information of three agrees together, let him receive it.</item>
        <item>Let not a king publicly confer on a spy any marks of his favour; if he does, he will divulge his own secret.</item>
        <item>Energy makes out the man of property; as for those who are destitute of it, do they (really) possess what they possess ?.</item>
        <item>The possession of (energy of) mind is true property; the possession of wealth passes away and abides not.</item>
        <item>They who are possessed of enduring energy will not trouble themselves, saying, "we have lost our property".</item>
        <item>Wealth will find its own way to the man of unfailing energy.</item>
        <item>The stalks of water-flowers are proportionate to the depth of water; so is men\'s greatness proportionate to their minds.</item>
        <item>In all that a king thinks of, let him think of his greatness; and if it should be thrust from him (by fate), it will have the nature of not being thrust from him.</item>
        <item>The strong minded will not faint, even when all is lost; the elephant stands firm, even when wounded by a shower of arrows.</item>
        <item>Those who have no (greatness of) mind, will not acquire the joy of saying in the world, "we have excercised liaberality".</item>
        <item>Although the elephant has a large body, and a sharp tusk, yet it fears the attack of the tiger.</item>
        <item>Energy is mental wealth; those men who are destitute of it are only trees in the form of men.</item>
        <item>By the darkness, of idleness, the indestructible lamp of family (rank) will be extinguished.</item>

        <item>The (lustre of the) family of the ignorant man, who acts under the influence of destructive laziness will perish, even before he is dead.</item>
        <item>Family (greatness) will be destroyed, and faults will increase, in those men who give way to laziness, and put forth no dignified exertions.</item>
        <item>Procrastination, forgetfulness, idleness, and sleep, these four things, form the vessel which is desired by those destined to destruction.</item>
        <item>It is a rare thing for the idle, even when possessed of the riches of kings who ruled over the whole earth, to derive any great benefit from it.</item>
        <item>Those who through idleness, and do not engage themselves in dignified exertion, will subject themselves to rebukes and reproaches.</item>
        <item>If idleness take up its abode in a king of high birth, it will make him a slave of his enemies.</item>
        <item>When a man puts away idleness, the reproach which has come upon himself and his family will disappear.</item>
        <item>The king who never gives way to idleness will obtain entire possession of (the whole earth) passed over by him who measured (the worlds) with His foot.</item>
        <item>Yield not to the feebleness which says, "this is too difficult to be done"; labour will give the greatness (of mind) which is necessary (to do it).</item>
        <item>Take care not to give up exertion in the midst of a work; the world will abandon those who abandon their unfinished work.</item>
        <item>The lustre of munificence will dwell only with the dignity of laboriousness or efforts.</item>
        <item>The liberality of him, who does not labour, will fail, like the manliness of a hermaphrodite, who has a sword in its hand.</item>
        <item>He who desires not pleasure, but desires labour, will be a pillar to sustain his relations, wiping away their sorrows.</item>
        <item>Labour will produce wealth; idleness will bring poverty.</item>
        <item>They say that the black Mudevi (the goddess of adversity) dwells with laziness, and the Latchmi (the goddess of prosperity) dwells with the labour of the industrious.</item>
        <item>Adverse fate is no disgrace to any one; to be without exertion and without knowing what should be known, is disgrace.</item>
        <item>Although it be said that, through fate, it cannot be attained, yet labour, with bodily exertion, will yield its reward.</item>
        <item>They who labour on, without fear and without fainting will see even fate (put) behind their back.</item>
        <item>If troubles come, laugh; there is nothing like that, to press upon and drive away sorrow.</item>
        <item>A flood of troubles will be overcome by the (courageous) thought which the minds of the wise will entertain, even in sorrow.</item>
        <item>They give sorrow to sorrow, who in sorrow do not suffer sorrow.</item>
        <item>Troubles will vanish (i.e., will be troubled) before the man who (struggles against difficulties) as a buffalo (drawing a cart) through deep mire.</item>
        <item>The troubles of that man will be troubled (and disappear) who, however thickly they may come upon him, does not abandon (his purpose).</item>
        <item>Will those men ever cry out in sorrow, "we are destitute" who, (in their prosperity), give not way to (undue desire) to keep their wealth.</item>
        <item>The great will not regard trouble as trouble, knowing that the body is the butt of trouble.</item>
        <item>That man never experiences sorrow, who does not seek for pleasure, and who considers distress to be natural (to man).</item>
        <item>He does not suffer sorrow, in sorrow who does not look for pleasure in pleasure.</item>
        <item>The elevation, which even his enemies will esteem, will be gained by him, who regards pain as pleasure.</item>
        <item>The minister is one who can make an excellent choice of means, time, manner of execution, and the difficult undertaking (itself).</item>
        <item>The minister is one who in addition to the aforesaid five things excels in the possession of firmness, protection of subjects, clearness by learning, and perseverance.</item>
        <item>The minister is one who can effect discord (among foes), maintain the good-will of his friends and restore to friendship those who have seceded (from him).</item>
        <item>The minister is one who is able to comprehend (the whole nature of an undertaking), execute it in the best manner possible, and offer assuring advice (in time of necessity).</item>
        <item>He is the best helper (of the king) who understanding the duties, of the latter, is by his special learning, able to tender the fullest advice, and at all times conversant with the best method (of performing actions).</item>
        <item>What (contrivances) are there so acute as to resist those who possess natural acuteness in addition to learning ?.</item>
        <item>Though you are acquainted with the (theoretical) methods (of performing an act), understand the ways of the world and act accordingly.</item>
        <item>Although the king be utterly ignorant, it is the duty of the minister to give (him) sound advice.</item>
        <item>Far better are seventy crores of enemies (for a king) than a minister at his side who intends (his) ruin.</item>
        <item>Those ministers who are destitute of (executive) ability will fail to carry out their projects, although they may have contrived aright.</item>
        <item>The possession of that goodness which is called the goodness of speech is (even to others) better than any other goodness.</item>
        <item>Since (both) wealth and evil result from (their) speech, ministers should most carefully guard themselves against faultiness therein.</item>
        <item>The (minister\'s) speech is that which seeks (to express) elements as bind his friends (to himself) and is so delivered as to make even his enemies desire (his friendship).</item>
        <item>Understand the qualities (of your hearers) and (then) make your speech; for superior to it, there is neither virtue nor wealth.</item>
        <item>Deliver your speech, after assuring yourself that no counter speech can defeat your own.</item>
        <item>It is the opinion of those who are free from defects in diplomacy that the minister should speak so as to make his hearers desire (to hear more) and grasp the meaning of what he hears himself.</item>
        <item>It is impossible for any one to conquer him by intrique who possesses power of speech, and is neither faulty nor timid.</item>
        <item>If there be those who can speak on various subjects in their proper order and in a pleasing manner, the world would readily accept them.</item>
        <item>They will desire to utter many words, who do not know how to speak a few faultless ones.</item>
        <item>Those who are unable to set forth their acquirements (before others) are like flowers blossoming in a cluster and yet without fragrance.</item>
        <item>The efficacy of support will yield (only) wealth; (but) the efficacy of action will yield all that is desired.</item>
        <item>Ministers should at all times avoid acts which, in addition to fame, yield no benefit (for the future).</item>
        <item>Those who say, "we will become (better)" should avoid the performance of acts that would destroy (their fame).</item>
        <item>Those who have infallible judgement though threatened with peril will not do acts which have brought disgrace (on former ministers).</item>
        <item>Let a minister never do acts of which he would have to grieve saying, "what is this I have done"; (but) should he do (them), it were good that he grieved not.</item>
        <item>Though a minister may see his mother starve; let him do not act which the wise would (treat with contempt).</item>
        <item>Far more excellent is the extreme poverty of the wise than wealth obtained by heaping up of sinful deeds.</item>
        <item>The actions of those, who have not desisted from doing deeds forbidden (by the great), will, even if they succeed, cause them sorrow.</item>
        <item>All that has been obtained with tears (to the victim) will depart with tears (to himself); but what has been by fair means; though with loss at first, will afterwards yield fruit.</item>
        <item>(For a minister) to protect (his king) with wealth obtained by foul means is like preserving a vessel of wet clay by filling it with water.</item>
        <item>Firmness in action is (simply) one\'s firmness of mind; all other (abilities) are not of this nature.</item>
        <item>Not to perform a ruinous act, and not to be discouraged by the ruinous termination of an act, are the two maxims which, the wise say, from the principles of those who have investigated the subject.</item>
        <item>So to perform an act as to publish it (only) at its termination is (true) manliness; for to announce it beforehand, will cause irremediable sorrow.</item>
        <item>To say (how an act is to be performed) is (indeed) easy for any one; but far difficult it is to do according to what has been said.</item>
        <item>The firmness in action of those who have become great by the excellence (of their counsel) will, by attaining its fulfilment in the person of the king, be esteemed (by all).</item>
        <item>If those who have planned (an undertaking) possess firmness (in executing it) they will obtain what they have desired even as they have desired it.</item>
        <item>Let none be despised for (their) size; (for) the world has those who resemble the linch-pin of the big rolling car.</item>
        <item>An act that has been firmly resolved on must be as firmly carried out without delay.</item>
        <item>Though it should cause increasing sorrow (at the outset), do with firmness the act that yield bliss (in the end)</item>
        <item>The great will not esteem those who esteem not firmness of action, whatever other abilities the latter may possess.</item>
        <item>Consultation ends in forming a resolution (to act); (but) delay in the execution of that resolve is an evil.</item>
        <item>Sleep over such (actions) as may be slept over; (but) never over such as may not be slept over.</item>
        <item>Whenever it is possible (to overcome your enemy) the act (of fighting) is certainly good; if not, endeavour to employ some more successful method.</item>
        <item>When duly considered, the incomplete execution of an undertaking and hostility will grow and destroy one like the (unextinguished) remnant of a fire.</item>
        <item>Do an act after a due consideration of the (following) five, viz. money, means, time, execution and place.</item>
        <item>An act is to be performed after considering the exertion required, the obstacles to be encountered, and the great profit to be gained (on its completion).</item>
        <item>The method of performance for one who has begun an act is to ascertain the mind of him who knows the secret thereof.</item>
        <item>To make one undertaking the means of accomplishing another (similar to it) is like making one rutting elephant the means of capturing another.</item>
        <item>One should rather hasten to secure the alliance of the foes (of one\'s foes) than perform good offices to one\'s friends.</item>
        <item>Ministers of small states, afraid of their people being frightened, will yield to and acknowledge their superior foes, if the latter offer them a chance of reconciliation.</item>
        <item>The qualification of an ambassador are affection (for his relations) a fitting birth, and the possession of attributes pleasing to royalty.</item>
        <item>Love (to his sovereign), knowledge (of his affairs), and a discriminating power of speech (before other sovereigns) are the three sine qua non qualifications of an ambassador.</item>
        <item>To be powerful in politics among those who are learned (in ethics) is the character of him who speaks to lance-bearing kings on matters of triumph (to his own sovereign).</item>
        <item>He may go on a mission (to foreign rulers) who has combined in him all these three. viz., (natural) sense, an attractive bearing and well-tried learning.</item>
        <item>He is an ambassador who (in the presence of foreign rulers) speaks briefly, avoids harshness, talks so as to make them smile, and thus brings good (to his own sovereign).</item>
        <item>He is an ambassador who having studied (politics) talks impressively, is not afraid of angry looks, and knows (to employ) the art suited to the time.</item>
        <item>He is chief (among ambassadors) who understands the proper decorum (before foreign princes), seeks the (proper) occasion, knows the (most suitable) place, and delivers his message after (due) consideration.</item>
        <item>The qualifications of him who faithfully delivers his (sovereign\'s) message are purity, the support (of foreign ministers), and boldness, with truthfulness in addition to the (aforesaid) three.</item>
        <item>He alone is fit to communicate (his sovereign\'s) reply, who possesses the firmness not to utter even inadvertently what may reflect discredit (on the latter).</item>
        <item>He is the ambassador who fearlessly seeks his sovereign\'s good though it should cost him his life (to deliver his message).</item>
        <item>Ministers who serve under fickle-minded monarchs should, like those who warm themselves at the fire, be neither (too) far, nor (too) near.</item>
        <item>For ministers not to cover the things desired by their kings will through the kings themselves yield them everlasting wealth.</item>
        <item>Ministers who would save themselves should avoid (the commission of) serious errors for if the king\'s suspicion is once roused, no one can remove it.</item>
        <item>While in the presence of the sovereign, ministers should neither whisper to nor smile at others.</item>
        <item>(When the king is engaged) in secret counsel (with others), ministers should neither over-hear anything whatever nor pry into it with inquisitive questions, but (wait to) listen when it is divulged (by the king himself).</item>
        <item>Knowing the (king\'s disposition and seeking the right time, (the minister) should in a pleasing manner suggest things such as are desirable and not disagreeable.</item>
        <item>Ministers should (always) give agreeable advice but on no occasion recommend useless actions, though requested (to do so).</item>
        <item>Ministers should behave in accordance with the (Divine) light in the person of kings and not despise them saying, "He is our junior (in age) and connected with our family!".</item>
        <item>Those whose judgement is firm will not do what is disagreeable (to the sovereign) saying (within themselves) "We are esteemed by the king".</item>
        <item>The (foolish) claim with which a minister does unbecoming acts because of his (long) familiarity (with the king) will ensure his ruin.</item>
        <item>The minister who by looking (at the king) understands his mind without being told (of it), will be a perpetual ornament to the world which is surrounded by a never-drying sea.</item>
        <item>He is to be esteemed a god who is able to ascertain without a doubt what is within (one\'s mind).</item>
        <item>The king should ever give whatever (is asked) of his belongings and secure him who, by the indications (of his own mind) is able to read those of another.</item>
        <item>Those who understand one\'s thoughts without being informed (thereof) and those who do not, may (indeed) resemble one another bodily; still are they different (mentally).</item>
        <item>Of what use are the eyes amongst one\'s members, if they cannot by their own indications dive those of another ?.</item>
        <item>As the mirror reflects what is near so does the face show what is uppermost in the mind.</item>
        <item>Is there anything so full of knowledge as the face ? (No.) it precedes the mind, whether (the latter is) pleased or vexed.</item>
        <item>If the king gets those who by looking into his mind can understand (and remove) what has occurred (to him) it is enough that he stand looking at their face.</item>
        <item>If a king gets ministers who can read the movements of the eye, the eyes (of foreign kings) will (themselves) reveal (to him) their hatred or friendship.</item>
        <item>The measuring-rod of those (ministers) who say "we are acute" will on inquiry be found to be their (own) eyes and nothing else.</item>
        <item>Let the pure who know the arrangement of words speak with deliberation after ascertaining (the nature of) the court (then assembled).</item>
        <item>Let the good who know the uses of words speak with a clear knowledge after ascertaining the time (suited to the court).</item>
        <item>Those who undertake to speak without knowing the (nature of the) court are ignorant of the quality of words as well as devoid of the power (of learning).</item>
        <item>Ministers should be lights in the assembly of the enlightned, but assume the pure whiteness of mortar (ignorance) in that of fools.</item>
        <item>The modesty by which one does not rush forward and speak in (an assembly of) superiors is the best among all (one\'s) good qualities.</item>
        <item>(For a minister) to blunder in the presence of those who have acquired a vast store of learning and know (the value thereof) is like a good man stumbling (and falling away) from the path (of virtue).</item>
        <item>The learning of those who have read and understood (much) will shine in the assembly of those who faultlessly examine (the nature of) words.</item>
        <item>Lecturing to those who have the ability to understand (for themselves) is like watering a bed of plants that are growing (of themselves).</item>
        <item>Those who are able to speak good things impressively in an assembly of the good should not even forgetfully speak them in that of the low.</item>
        <item>To utter (a good word) in the assembly of those who are of inferior rank is like dropping nectar on the ground.</item>
        <item>The pure who know the classification of words having first ascertained the nature (of the court) will not (through fear) falter in their speech before the powerful body.</item>
        <item>Those who can agreeably set forth their acquirements before the learned will be regarded as the most learned among the learned.</item>
        <item>Many indeed may (fearlessly) die in the presence of (their) foes; (but) few are those who are fearless in the assembly (of the learned).</item>
        <item>(Ministers) should agreeably set forth their acquirements before the learned and acquire more (knowledge) from their superiors (in learning).</item>
        <item>In order to reply fearlessly before a foreign court, (ministers) should learn logic according to the rules (of grammar).</item>
        <item>What have they to do with a sword who are not valiant, or they with learning who are afraid of an intelligent assembly ?.</item>
        <item>The learning of him who is diffident before an assembly is like the shining sword of an hermaphrodite in the presence of his foes.</item>
        <item>Those who cannot agreeably speak good things before a good assembly are indeed unprofitable persons inspite of all their various acquirements.</item>
        <item>They who, though they have learned and understood, are yet afraid of the assembly of the good, are said to be inferior (even) to the illiterate.</item>
        <item>Those who through fear of the assembly are unable to set forth their learning in an interesting manner, though alive, are yet like the dead.</item>
        <item>A kingdom is that in which (those who carry on) a complete cultivation, virtuous persons, and merchants with inexhaustible wealth, dwell together.</item>
        <item>A kingdom is that which is desire for its immense wealth, and which grows greatly in prosperity, being free from destructive causes.</item>
        <item>A kingdom is that which can bear any burden that may be pressed on it (from adjoining kingdoms) and (yet) pay the full tribute to its sovereign.</item>
        <item>kingdom is that which continues to be free from excessive starvation, irremediable epidemics, and destructive foes.</item>
        <item>A kingdom is that which is without various (irregular) associations, destructive internal enemies, and murderous savages who (sometimes) harass the sovereign.</item>
        <item>The learned say that the best kingdom is that which knows no evil (from its foes), and, if injured (at all), suffers no diminution in its fruitfulness.</item>
        <item>The constituents of a kingdom are the two waters (from above and below), well situated hills and an undestructible fort.</item>
        <item>Freedom from epidemics, wealth, produce, happiness and protection (to subjects); these five, the learned, say, are the ornaments of a kingdom.</item>
        <item>The learned say that those are kingdom whose wealth is not laboured for, and those not, whose wealth is only obtained through labour.</item>
        <item>Although in possession of all the above mentioned excellences, these are indeed of no use to a country, in the absence of harmony between the sovereign and the sujects.</item>
        <item>A fort is an object of importance to those who march (against their foes) as well as to those who through fear (of pursuers) would seek it for shelter.</item>
        <item>A fort is that which has everlasting water, plains, mountains and cool shady forests.</item>
        <item>The learned say that a fortress is an enclosure having these four (qualities) viz., height, breadth, strength and inaccessibility.</item>
        <item>A fort is that which has an extensive space within, but only small places to be guarded, and such as can destroy the courage of besieging foes.</item>
        <item>A fort is that which cannot be captured, which abounds in suitable provisions, and affords a position of easy defence to its inmates.</item>
        <item>A fort is that which has all (needful) things, and excellent heroes that can help it against destruction (by foes).</item>
        <item>A fort is that which cannot be captured by blockading, assaulting, or undermining it.</item>
        <item>That is a fort whose inmates are able to overcome without losing their ground, even abler men who have besieged it.</item>
        <item>A fort is that which derives excellence from the stratagems made (by its inmates) to defeat their enemies in the battlefield.</item>
        <item>Although a fort may possess all (the above-said) excellence, it is, as it were without these, if its inmates possess not the excellence of action.</item>
        <item>Besides wealth there is nothing that can change people of no importance into those of (some) importance.</item>
        <item>All despise the poor; (but) all praise the rich.</item>
        <item>The imperishable light of wealth goes into regions desired (by its owner) and destroys the darkness (of enmity therein).</item>
        <item>The wealth acquired with a knowledge of the proper means and without foul practices will yield virtue and happiness.</item>
        <item>(Kings) should rather avoid than seek the accumulation of wealth which does not flow in with mercy and love.</item>
        <item>Unclaimed wealth, wealth acquired by taxes, and wealth (got) by conquest of foes are (all) the wealth of the king.</item>
        <item>The child mercy which is borne by love grows under the care of the rich nurse of wealth.</item>
        <item>An undertaking of one who has wealth in one\'s hands is like viewing an elephant-fight from a hill-top.</item>
        <item>Accumulate wealth; it will destroy the arrogance of (your) foes; there is no weapon sharper than it.</item>
        <item>To those who have honestly acquired an abundance of riches, the other two, (virtue and pleasure) are things easy (of acquisition).</item>
        <item>The army which is complete in (its) parts and conquers without fear of wounds is the chief wealth of the king.</item>
        <item>Ancient army can alone have the valour which makes it stand by its king at the time of defeat, fearless of wounds and unmindful of its reduced strength.</item>
        <item>What if (a host of) hostile rats roar like the sea ? They will perish at the mere breath of the cobra.</item>
        <item>That indeed is an army which has stood firm of old without suffering destruction or deserting (to the enemy).</item>
        <item>That indeed is an army which is capable of offering a united resistance, even if Yama advances against it with fury.</item>
        <item>Valour, honour, following in the excellent-footsteps (of its predecessors) and trust-worthiness; these four alone constitute the safeguard of an army</item>
        <item>That is an army which knowing the art of warding off an impending struggle, can bear against the dust-van (of a hostile force).</item>
        <item>Though destitute of courage to fight and strength (to endure), an army may yet gain renown by the splendour of its appearance.</item>
        <item>An army can triumph (over its foes) if it is free from diminution; irremediable aversion and poverty.</item>
        <item>Though an army may contain a large number of permanent soldiers, it cannot last if it has no generals.</item>
        <item>O my foes, stand not before my leader; (for) many are those who did so but afterwards stood (in the shape of) statues.</item>
        <item>It is more pleasant to hold the dart that has missed an elephant than that which has hit hare in the forest.</item>
        <item>The learned say that fierceness (incontest with a foe) is indeed great valour; but to become a benefactor in case of accident (to a foe) is the extreme (limit) of that valour.</item>
        <item>The hero who after casting the lance in his hand on an elephant, comes (in search of another) will pluck the one (that sticks) in his body and laugh (exultingly).</item>
        <item>Is it not a defeat to the valiant to wink and destroy their ferocious look when a lance in cast at them (by their foe) ?.</item>
        <item>The hero will reckon among wasted days all those on which he had not received severe wounds.</item>
        <item>The fastening of ankle-ring by those who disire a world-wide renown and not (the safety of) their lives is like adorning (themselves).</item>
        <item>The heroes who are not afraid of losing their life in a contest will not cool their ardour, even if the king prohibits (their fighting).</item>
        <item>Who would reproach with failure those who seal their oath with their death ?.</item>
        <item>If (heroes) can so die as to fill with tears the eyes of their rulers, such a death deserves to be obtained even by begging.</item>
        <item>What things are there so difficult to acquire as friendship ? What guards are there so difficult to break through by the efforts (of one\'s foes) ? .</item>
        <item>The friendship of the wise waxes like the new moon; (but) that of fools wanes like the full moon.</item>
        <item>Like learning, the friendship of the noble, the more it is cultivated, the more delightful does it become.</item>
        <item>Friendship is to be practised not for the purpose of laughing but for that of being beforehand in giving one another sharp rebukes in case of transgression.</item>
        <item>Living together and holding frequent intercourse are not necessary (for friendship); (mutual) understanding can alone create a claim for it.</item>
        <item>The love that dwells (merely in the smiles of the face is not friendship; (but) that which dwells deep in the smiles of the heart is true friendship.</item>
        <item>(True) friendship turns aside from evil (ways) makes (him) walk in the (good) way, and, in case of loss if shares his sorrow (with him).</item>
        <item>(True) friendship hastens to the rescue of the afflicted (as readily) as the hand of one whose garment is loosened (before an assembly).</item>
        <item>Friendship may be said to be on its throne when it possesses the power of supporting one at all times and under all circumstances, (in the practice or virtue and wealth).</item>
        <item>Though friends may praise one another saying, "He is so intimate with us, and we so much (with him)"; (still) such friendship will appear mean.</item>
        <item>As those who are of a friendly nature will not forsake (a friend) after once loving (him), there is no evil so great as contracting a friendship without due inquiry.</item>
        <item>The friendship contracted by him who has not made repeated inquiry will in the end grieve (him) to death.</item>
        <item>Make friendship (with one) after ascertaining (his) character, birth, defects and the whole of one\'s relations.</item>
        <item>The friendship of one who belongs to a (good) family and is afraid of (being charged with) guilt, is worth even purchasing.</item>
        <item>You should examine and secure the friendship of those who can speak so as to make you weep over a crime (before its commission) or rebuke you severely (after you have done it) and are able to teach you (the ways of) the world.</item>
        <item>Even in ruin there is some good; (for) it is a rod by which one may measure fully (the affection of one\'s) relations.</item>
        <item>It is indead a gain for one to renounce the friendship of fools.</item>
        <item>Do not think of things that discourage your mind, nor contract friendship with those who would forsake you in adversity.</item>
        <item>The very thought of the friendship of those who have deserted one at the approach of adversity will burn one\'s mind at the time of death.</item>
        <item>Continue to enjoy the friendship of the pure; (but) renounce even with a gift, the friendship of those who do not agree (with the world).</item>
        <item>Imtimate friendship is that which cannot in the least be injured by (things done through the) right (of longstanding intimacy).</item>
        <item>The constituents of friendship are (things done through) the right of intimacy; to be pleased with such a right is the duty of the wise.</item>
        <item>Of what avail is long-standing friendship, if friends do not admit as their own actions done through the right of intimacy ?.</item>

        <item>Strangers will inherit the riches that have been acquired without regard for friendship, comfort and charity.</item>
        <item>The short-lived poverty of those who are noble and rich is like the clouds becoming poor (for a while).</item>
        <item>True modesty is the fear of (evil) deeds; all other modesty is (simply) the bashfulness of virtuous maids.</item>
        <item>Food, clothing and the like are common to all men but modesty is peculiar to the good.</item>
        <item>As the body is the abode of the spirit, so the excellence of modesty is the abode of perfection.</item>
        <item>The Is not the modesty ornament of the noble ? Without it, their haughtiness would be a pain (to others).</item>
        <item>The world regards as the abode of modesty him who fear his own and other\'s guilt.</item>
        <item>The great make modesty their barrier (of defence) and not the wide world.</item>
        <item>The modest would rather lose their life for the sake of modesty than lose modesty for the sake of life.</item>
        <item>Virtue is likely to forsake him who shamelessly does what others are ashamed of.</item>
        <item>Want of manners injures one\'s family; but want of modesty injures one\'s character.</item>
        <item>The actions of those who are without modesty at heart are like those of puppet moved by a string.</item>
        <item>There is no higher greatness than that of one saying. I will not cease in my effort (to raise my family).</item>
        <item>One\'s family is raised by untiring perseverance in both effort and wise contrivances.</item>
        <item>The Deity will clothe itself and appear before him who resolves on raising his family.</item>
        <item>Those who are prompt in their efforts (to better their family) need no deliberation, such efforts will of themselves succeed.</item>
        <item>People will eagerly seek the friendship of the prosperous soul who has raised his family without foul means.</item>
        <item>A man\'s true manliness consists in making himself the head and benefactor of his family.</item>
        <item>Like heroes in the battle-field, the burden (of protection etc.) is borne by those who are the most efficient in a family.</item>
        <item>As a family suffers by (one\'s) indolence and false dignity there is to be so season (good or bad) to those who strive to raise their family.</item>
        <item>Is it only to suffering that his body is exposed who undertakes to preserve his family from evil ?.</item>
        <item>If there are none to prop up and maintain a family (in distress), it will fall at the stroke of the axe of misfortune.</item>
        <item>Agriculture, though laborious, is the most excellent (form of labour); for people, though they go about (in search of various employments), have at last to resort to the farmer.</item>
        <item>Agriculturists are (as it were) the linch-pin of the world for they support all other workers who cannot till the soil.</item>
        <item>They alone live who live by agriculture; all others lead a cringing, dependent life.</item>
        <item>The Patriotic farmers desire to bring all other states under the control of their own king.</item>
        <item>Those whose nature is to live by manual labour will never beg but give something to those who beg.</item>
        <item>If the farmer\'s hands are slackened, even the ascetic state will fail.</item>
        <item>If the land is dried so as to reduce one ounce of earth to a quarter, it will grow plentifully even without a handful of manure.</item>
        <item>Manuring is better than ploughing; after weeding, watching is better than watering (it).</item>
        <item>If the owner does not (personally) attend to his cultivation, his land will behave like an angry wife and yield him no pleasure.</item>
        <item>The maiden, Earth, will laugh at the sight of those who plead poverty and lead an idle life.</item>
        <item>There is nothing that afflicts (one) like poverty.</item>
        <item>When cruel poverty comes on, it deprives one of both the present and future (bliss).</item>
        <item>Hankering poverty destroys at once the greatness of (one\'s) ancient descent and (the dignity of one\'s) speech.</item>
        <item>Even in those of high birth, poverty will produce the fault of uttering mean words.</item>
        <item>The misery of poverty brings in its train many (more) miseries.</item>
        <item>The words of the poor are profitless, though they may be sound in thought and clear in expression.</item>
        <item>He that is reduced to absolute poverty will be regarded as a stranger even by his own mother.</item>
        <item>Is the poverty that almost killed me yesterday, to meet me today too ?.</item>
        <item>One may sleep in the midst of fire; but by no means in the midst of poverty.</item>
        <item>The destitute poor, who do not renounce their bodies, only consume their neighbour\'s salt and water.</item>
        <item>If you meet with those that may be begged of, you may beg; (but) if they withhold (their gift) it is their blame and not yours.</item>
        <item>Even begging may be pleasant, if what is begged for is obtained without grief (to him that begs).</item>
        <item>There is even a beauty in standing before and begging of those who are liberal in their gifts and understand their duty (to beggars).</item>
        <item>To beg of such as never think of withholding (their charity) even in their dreams, is in fact the same as giving (it oneself).</item>
        <item>As there are in the world those that give without refusing, there are (also) those that prefer to beg by simply standing before them.</item>
        <item>All the evil of begging will be removed at the sight of those who are far from the evil of refusing.</item>
        <item>Beggars rejoice exceedingly when they behold those who bestow (their alms) with kindness and courtesy.</item>
        <item>If there were no beggars, (the actions done in) the cool wide world would only resemble the movement of a puppet.</item>
        <item>What (praise) would there be to givers (of alms) if there were no beggars to ask for and reveive (them).</item>
        <item>He who begs ought not to be angry (at a refusal); for even the misery of (his own) poverty should be a sufficient reason (for so doing).</item>
        <item>Not to beg (at all) even from those excellent persons who cheerfully give without refusing, will do immense good.</item>
        <item>If the Creator of the world has decreed even begging as a means of livelihood, may he too go abegging and perish.</item>
        <item>There is no greater folly than the boldness with which one seeks to remedy the evils of poverty by begging (rather than by working).</item>
        <item>Even the whole world cannot sufficiently praise the dignity that would not beg even in the midst of destitution.</item>
        <item>Even thin gruel is ambrosia to him who has obtained it by labour.</item>
        <item>There is nothing more disgraceful to one\'s tongue than to use it in begging water even for a cow.</item>
        <item>I beseech all beggars and say, "If you need to beg, never beg of those who give unwillingly".</item>
        <item>The unsafe raft of begging will split when it strikes on the rock of refusal.</item>
        <item>To think of (the evil of) begging is enough to melt one\'s heart; but to think of refusal is enough to break it.</item>
        <item>Saying "No" to a beggar takes away his life. (but as that very word will kill the refuser) where then would the latter\'s life hide itself ?.</item>
        <item>The base resemble men perfectly (as regards form); and we have not seen such (exact) resemblance (among any other species).</item>
        <item>The low enjoy more felicity than those who know what is good; for the former are not troubled with anxiety (as to the good).</item>
        <item>The base resemble the Gods; for the base act as they like.</item>
        <item>The base feels proud when he sees persons whose acts meaner than his own.</item>
        <item>(The principle of) behaviour in the mean is chiefly fear; if not, hope of gain, to some extent.</item>
        <item>The base are like a drum that is beaten, for they unburden to others the secrets they have heard</item>
        <item>The mean will not (even) shake off (what sticks to) their hands (soon after a meal) to any but those who would break their jaws with their clenched fists.</item>
        <item>The great bestow (their alms) as soon as they are informed; (but) the mean, like the sugar-cane, only when they are tortured to death.</item>
        <item>The base will bring an evil (accusation) against others, as soon as he sees them (enjoying) good food and clothing.</item>
        <item>The base will hasten to sell themselves as soon as a calamity has befallen them. For what else are they fitted ?.</item>
        <item>Is this jewelled female a celestial, a choice peahen, or a human being ? My mind is perplexed</item>
        <item>This female beauty returning my looks is like a celestial maiden coming with an army to contend against me.</item>
        <item>I never knew before what is called Yama; I see it now; it is the eyes that carry on a great fight with (the help of) female qualities.</item>
        <item>These eyes that seem to kill those who look at them are as it were in hostilities with this feminine simplicity.</item>
        <item>Is it Yama, (a pair of) eyes or a hind ?- Are not all these three in the looks of this maid ?.</item>
        <item>Her eyes will cause (me) no trembling sorrow, if they are properly hidden by her cruel arched eye-brows.</item>
        <item>The cloth that covers the firm bosom of this maiden is (like) that which covers the eyes of a rutting elephant.</item>
        <item>On her bright brow alone is destroyed even that power of mine that used to terrify the most fearless foes in the battlefield.</item>
        <item>Of what use are other jewels to her who is adorned with modesty, and the meek looks of a hind ?.</item>
        <item>Unlike boiled honey which yields delight only when it is drunk, love gives pleasure even when looked at.</item>
        <item>There are two looks in the dyed eyes of this (fair one); one causes pain, and the other is the cure thereof.</item>
        <item>A single stolen glance of her eyes is more than half the pleasure (of sexual embrace).</item>
        <item>She has looked (at men) and stooped (her head); and that (sign) waters as it were (the corn of) our love.</item>
        <item>When I look, she looks down; when I do not, she looks and smiles gently.</item>
        <item>She not only avoids a direct look at me, but looks as it were with a half-closed eye and smiles.</item>
        <item>Though they may speak harshly as if they were strangers, the words of the friendly are soon understood.</item>
        <item>Little words that are harsh and looks that are hateful are (but) the expressions of lovers who wish to act like strangers.</item>
        <item>When I look, the pitying maid looks in return and smiles gently; and that is a comforting sign for me.</item>
        <item>Both the lovers are capable of looking at each other in an ordinary way, as if they were perfect strangers.</item>
        <item>The words of the mouths are of no use whatever, when there is perfect agreement between the eyes (of lovers).</item>
        <item>The (simultaneous) enjoyment of the five senses of sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch can only be found with bright braceleted (women).</item>
        <item>The remedy for a disease is always something different (from it); but for the disease caused by this jewelled maid, she is herself the cure.</item>
        <item>Can the lotus-eyed Vishnu\'s heaven be indeed as sweet to those who delight to sleep in the delicate arms of their beloved ?.</item>
        <item>From whence has she got this fire that burns when I withdraw and cools when I approach ?.</item>
        <item>The shoulders of her whose locks are adorned with flowers delight me as if they were the very sweets I have desired (to get).</item>
        <item>The shoulders of this fair one are made of ambrosia, for they revive me with pleasure every time I embrace them.</item>
        <item>The embraces of a gold-complexioned beautiful female are as pleasant as to dwell in one\'s own house and live by one\'s own (earnings) after distributing (a portion of it in charity).</item>
        <item>To ardent lovers sweet is the embrace that cannot be penetrated even by a breath of breeze.</item>
        <item>Love quarrel, reconciliation and intercourse - these are the advantages reaped by those who marry for lust.</item>
        <item>As (one\'s) ignorance is discovered the more one learns, so does repeated intercourse with a well-adorned female (only create a desire for more).</item>
        <item>May you flourish, O Anicham! you have a delicate nature. But my beloved is more delicate than you.</item>
        <item>O my soul, fancying that flowers which are seen by many can resemble her eyes, you become confused at the sight of them.</item>
        <item>The complexion of this bamboo-shouldered one is that of a shoot; her teeth, are pearls; her breath, fragrance; and her dyed eyes, lances.</item>
        <item>If the blue lotus could see, it would stoop and look at the ground saying, "I can never resemble the eyes of this excellent jewelled one".</item>
        <item>No merry drums will be beaten for the (tender) waist of her who has adorned herself with the anicham without having removed its stem.</item>
        <item>The stars have become confused in their places not being able to distinguish between the moon and the maid\'s countenance.</item>
        <item>Could there be spots in the face of this maid like those in the bright full moon ?.</item>
        <item>If you can indeed shine like the face of women, flourish, O moon, for then would you be worth loving ?.</item>
        <item>O moon, if you wish to resemble the face of her whose eyes are like (these) flowers, do not appear so as to be seen by all.</item>
        <item>The anicham and the feathers of the swan are to the feet of females, like the fruit of the (thorny) Nerunji.</item>
        <item>The water which oozes from the white teeth of this soft speeched damsel is like a mixture of milk and honey.</item>
        <item>The love between me and this damsel is like the union of body and soul.</item>
        <item>O you image in the pupil (of my eye)! depart; there is no room for (my) fair-browed beloved.</item>
        <item>My fair-jewelled one resembles the living soul (when she is in union with me), the dying soul when she leaves me.</item>
        <item>If I had forgotten her who has bright battling eyes, I would have remembered (thee); but I never forget her. (Thus says he to her maid).</item>
        <item>My lover would not depart from mine eyes; even if I wink, he would not suffer (from pain); he is so ethereal.</item>
        <item>As my lover abides in my eyes, I will not even paint them, for he would (then) have to conceal himself.</item>
        <item>As my lover is in my heart, I am afraid of eating (anything) hot, for I know it would pain him.</item>
        <item>I will not wink, knowing that if I did, my lover would hide himself; and for this reason, this town says, he is unloving.</item>
        <item>My lover dwells in my heart with perpetual delight; but the town says he is unloving and (therefore) dwells afar.</item>
        <item>To those who after enjoyment of sexual pleasure suffer (for want of more), there is no help so efficient as the palmyra horse.</item>
        <item>Having got rid of shame, the suffering body and soul save themselves on the palmyra horse.</item>
        <item>Modesty and manliness were once my own; now, my own is the palmyra horse that is ridden by the lustful.</item>
        <item>The raft of modesty and manliness, is, alas, carried-off by the strong current of lust.</item>
        <item>She with the small garland-like bracelets has given me the palmyra horse and the sorrow that is endured at night.</item>
        <item>Mine eyes will not close in sleep on your mistress\'s account; even at midnight will I think of mounting the palmyra horse.</item>
        <item>There is nothing so noble as the womanly nature that would not ride the palmyra horse, though plunged a sea of lust.</item>
        <item>Even the Lust (of women) transgresses its secrecy and appears in public, forgetting that they are too chaste and liberal (to be overcome by it).</item>
        <item>My lust, feeling that it is not known by all, reels confused in the streets (of this town).</item>
        <item>Even strangers laugh (at us) so as to be seen by us, for they have not suffered.</item>
        <item>My precious life is saved by the raise of rumour, and this, to my good luck no others are aware of.</item>
        <item>Not knowing the value of her whose eyes are like flowers this town has got up a rumour about me.</item>
        <item>Will I not get a rumour that is known to the (whole) town ? For what I have not got is as if I had got it (already).</item>
        <item>Rumour increases the violence of my passion; without it it would grow weak and waste away.</item>
        <item>As drinking liquor is delightful (to one) whenever one is in mirth, so is lust delightful to me whenever it is the subject of rumour.</item>
        <item>It was but a single day that I looked on (my lover); but the rumour thereof has spread like the seizure of the moon by the serpent.</item>
        <item>This malady (of lust) is manured by the talk of women and watered by the (harsh) words of my mother.</item>
        <item>To say that one could extinguish passion by rumour is like extinguishing fire with ghee.</item>
        <item>When the departure of him who said "fear not" has put me to shame before others, why need I be ashamed of scandal.</item>
        <item>The rumour I desire is raised by the town (itself); and my lover would if desired consent (to my following him).</item>
        <item>If it is not departure, tell me; but if it is your speedy return, tell it to those who would be alive then.</item>
        <item>His very look was once pleasing; but (now) even intercourse is painful through fear of separation.</item>
        <item>As even the lover who understands (everything) may at times depart, confidence is hardly possible.</item>
        <item>If he who bestowed his love and said "fear not" should depart, will it be the fault of those who believed in (his) assuring words ?.</item>
        <item>If you would save (my life), delay the departure of my destined (husband); for if he departs, intercourse will become impossible.</item>
        <item>If he is so cruel as to mention his departure (to me), the hope that he would bestow (his love) must be given up.</item>
        <item>Do not the rings that begin to slide down my fingers forebode the separation of my lord ?.</item>
        <item>Painful is it to live in a friendless town; but far more painful is it to part from one\'s lover.</item>
        <item>Fire burns when touched; but, like the sickness of love, can it also burn when removed ?.</item>
        <item>As if there were many indeed that can consent to the impossible, kill their pain, endure separation and yet continue to live afterwards.</item>
        <item>I would hide this pain from others; but it (only) swells like a spring to those who drain it.</item>
        <item>I cannot conceal this pain, nor can I relate it without shame to him who has caused it.</item>
        <item>(Both) lust and shame, with my soul for their shoulder pole balance themselves on a body that cannot bear them.</item>
        <item>There is indeed a flood of lust; but there is no raft of safety to cross it with.</item>
        <item>He who can produce sorrow from friendship, what can he not bring forth out of enmity ?.</item>
        <item>The pleasure of lust is (as great as) the sea; but the pain of lust is far greater.</item>
        <item>I have swam across the terrible flood of lust, but have not seen its shore; even at midnight I am alone; still I live.</item>
        <item>The night which graciously lulls to sleep all living creatures, has me alone for her companion.</item>
        <item>The long nights of these days are far more cruel than the heartless one who is torturing me.</item>
        <item>Could mine eyes travel like my thoughts to the abode (of my absent lord), they would not swim in this flood of tears.</item>
        <item>As this incurable malady has been caused by my eyes which showed (him) to me, why should they now weep for (him).</item>
        <item>The dyed eyes that (then) looked without foresight, why should they now endure sorrow, without feeling sharply (their own fault).</item>
        <item>They themselves looked eagerly (on him) and now they weep. Is not this to be laughed at ?.</item>
        <item>These painted eyes have caused me a lasting mortal disease; and now they can weep no more, the tears having dried up.</item>
        <item>Mine eyes have caused me a lust that is greater than the sea and (they themselves) endure the torture of sleeplessness.</item>
        <item>The eyes that have given me this disease have themselves been seized with this (suffering). Oh! I am much delighted.</item>
        <item>The eyes that became tender and gazed intently on him, may they suffer so much as to dry up the fountain of their tears.</item>
        <item>He is indeed here who loved me with his lips but not with his heart but mine eyes suffer from not seeing him.</item>
        <item>When he is away they do not sleep; when he is present they do not sleep; in either case, mine eyes endure unbearable agony.</item>
        <item>It is not difficult for the people of this place to understand the secret of those whose eyes, like mine, are as it were beaten drums.</item>
        <item>I who (then) consented to the absence of my loving lord, to whom can I (now) relate the fact of my having turned sallow.</item>
        <item>Sallowness, as if proud of having been caused by him, would now ride on my person.</item>
        <item>He has taken (away) my beauty and modesty, and given me instead disease and sallowness.</item>
        <item>I think (of him); and what I speak about is but his excellence; still is there sallowness; and this is deceitful.</item>
        <item>Just as my lover departed then, did not sallowness spread here on my person ?.</item>
        <item>Just as darkness waits for the failing light; so does sallowness wait for the laxity of my husband\'s intercourse.</item>
        <item>I who was in close embrace just turned aside and the moment I did so, sallowness came on me like something to be seized on.</item>
        <item>Besides those who say "she has turned sallow" there are none who say "he has forsaken her".</item>
        <item>If he is clear of guilt who has conciliated me (to his departure) let my body suffer its due and turn sallow.</item>
        <item>It would be good to be said of me that I have turned sallow, if friends do not reproach with unkindness him who pleased me (then).</item>
        <item>The women who are beloved by those whom they love, have they have not got the stone-less fruit of sexual delight ?</item>
        <item>The bestowal of love by the beloved on those who love them is like the rain raining (at the proper season) on those who live by it.</item>
        <item>The pride that says "we shall live" suits only those who are loved by their beloved (husbands).</item>
        <item>Even those who are esteemed (by other women) are devoid of excellence, if they are not loved by their beloved.</item>
        <item>He who is beloved by me, what will he do to me, if I am not beloved by him ?.</item>
        <item>Lust, like the weight of the KAVADI, pains if it lies in one end only but pleases if it is in both.</item>
        <item>Would not cupid who abides and contends in one party (only) witness the pain and sorrow (in that party)?</item>
        <item>There is no one in the world so hard-hearted as those who can live without receiving (even) a kind word from their beloved.</item>
        <item>Though my beloved bestows no love on one, still are his words sweet to my ears.</item>
        <item>Live, O my soul, would you who relate your great sorrow to strangers, try rather to fill up your own sea (of sorrow).</item>
        <item>Sexuality is sweeter than liquor, because when remembered, it creates a most rapturous delight</item>
        <item>Even to think of one\'s beloved gives one no pain. Sexuality, in any degree, is always delightful.</item>
        <item>I feel as if I am going to sneeze but do not, and (therefore) my beloved is about to think (of me) but does not.</item>
        <item>He continues to abide in my soul, do I likewise abide in his ?.</item>
        <item>He who has imprisoned me in his soul, is he ashamed to enter incessantly into mine.</item>
        <item>I live by remembering my (former) intercourse with him; if it were not so, how could I live ?.</item>
        <item>I have never forgotten (the pleasure); even to think of it burns my soul; could I live, if I should ever forget it ?.</item>
        <item>He will not be angry however much I may think of him; is it not so much the delight my beloved affords me ? .</item>
        <item>My precious life is wasting away by thinking too much on the cruelty of him who said we were not different.</item>
        <item>May you live, O Moon! Do not set, that I mine see him who has departed without quitting my soul.</item>
        <item>Where with shall I feast the dream which has brought me my dear one\'s messenger ?.</item>
        <item>If my fish-like painted eyes should, at my begging, close in sleep, I could fully relate my sufferings to my lord.</item>
        <item>My life lasts because in my dream I behold him who does not favour me in my waking hours.</item>
        <item>There is pleasure in my dream, because in it I seek and obtain him who does not visit me in my wakefulness.</item>
        <item>I saw him in my waking hours, and then it was pleasant; I see him just now in my dream, and it is (equally) pleasant.</item>
        <item>Were there no such thing as wakefulness, my beloved (who visited me) in my dream would not depart from me.</item>
        <item>The cruel one who would not favour me in my wakefulness, what right has he to torture me in my dreams?.</item>
        <item>When I am asleep he rests on my shoulders, (but) when I awake he hastens into my soul.</item>
        <item>They who have no dear ones to behold in their dreams blame him who visits me not in my waking hours.</item>
        <item>The women of this place say he has forsaken me in my wakefulness. I think they have not seen him visit me in my dreams.</item>
        <item>Live, O you evening are you (the former) evening? No, you are the season that slays (married) women</item>
        <item>A long life to you, O dark evening! You are sightless. Is your help-mate (also) as hard-hearted as mine.</item>
        <item>The evening that (once) came in with trembling and dimness (now) brings me an aversion for life and increasing sorrow.</item>
        <item>In the absence of my lover, evening comes in like slayers on the field of slaughter.</item>
        <item>What good have I done to morning (and) what evil to evening?.</item>
        <item>Previous to my husband\'s departure, I know not the painful nature of evening.</item>
        <item>This malady buds forth in the morning, expands all day long and blossoms in the evening.</item>
        <item>The shepherd\'s flute now sounds as a fiery forerunner of night, and is become a weapon that slays (me).</item>
        <item>When night comes on confusing (everyone\'s) mind, the (whole) town will lose its sense and be plunged in sorrow.</item>
        <item>My (hitherto) unextinguished life is now lost in this bewildering night at the thought of him who has the nature of wealth.</item>
        <item>While we endure the unbearable sorrow, your eyes weep for him who is gone afar, and shun (the sight of) fragrant flowers.</item>
        <item>The discoloured eyes that shed tears profusely seem to betray the unkindness of our beloved.</item>
        <item>The shoulders that swelled on the day of our union (now) seem to announce our separation clearly (to the public).</item>
        <item>In the absence of your consort, your shoulders having lost their former beauty and fulness, your bracelets of pure gold have become loose.</item>
        <item>The (loosened) bracelets, and the shoulders from which the old beauty has faded, relate the cruelty of the pitiless one.</item>
        <item>I am greatly pained to hear you call him a cruel man, just because your shoulders are reduced and your bracelets loosened.</item>
        <item>Can you O my soul! gain glory by relating to the (so-called) cruel one the clamour of my fading shoulders?.</item>
        <item>When I once loosened the arms that were in embrace, the forehead of the gold-braceleted women turned sallow.</item>
        <item>When but a breath of breeze penetrated our embrace, her large cool eyes became sallow.</item>
        <item>Was it at the sight of what the bright forehead had done that the sallowness of her eyes became sad?.</item>
        <item>O my soul, will you not think and tell me some medicine be it what it may, that can cure this incurable malady?.</item>
        <item>May you live, O my soul! While he is without love, for you to suffer is (simple) folly.</item>
        <item>O my soul! why remain (here) and suffer thinking (of him)? There are no lewd thoughts (of you) in him who has caused you this disease of sorrow.</item>
        <item>O my soul! take my eyes also with you, (if not), these would eat me up (in their desire) to see him.</item>
        <item>O my soul! can he who loves not though he is beloved, be forsaken saying he hates me (now)?.</item>
        <item>O my soul! when you see the dear one who remove dislike by intercourse, you are displeased and continue to be so. Nay, your displeasure is (simply) false.</item>
        <item>O my good soul, give up either lust or honour, as for me I can endure neither.</item>
        <item>You are a fool, O my soul! to go after my departed one, while you mourn that he is not kind enough to favour you.</item>
        <item>O my soul! to whom would you repair, while the dear one is within yourself?.</item>
        <item>If I retain in my heart him who has left me without befriending me, I shall lose even the (inward) beauty that remains.</item>
        <item>My precious life is saved by the raise of rumour, and this, to my good luck no others are aware of.</item>
        <item>Even at midnight is my mind worried by lust, and this one thing, alas! is without mercy.</item>
        <item>I would conceal my lust, but alas, it yields not to my will but breaks out like a sneeze.</item>
        <item>I say I would be firm, but alas, my malady breaks out from its concealment and appears in public.</item>
        <item>The dignity that would not go after an absent lover is not known to those who are sticken by love.</item>
        <item>The sorrow I have endured by desiring to go after my absent lover, in what way is it excellent?.</item>
        <item>I know nothing like shame when my beloved does from love (just) what is desired (by me).</item>
        <item>Are not the enticing words of my trick-abounding roguish lover the weapon that breaks away my feminine firmness?.</item>
        <item>I said I would feign dislike and so went (away); (but) I embraced him the moment I say my mind began to unite with him!.</item>
        <item>Is it possible for those whose hearts melt like fat in the fire to say they can feign a strong dislike and remain so?.</item>
        <item>My finger has worn away by marking (on the wall) the days he has been absent while my eyes have lost their lustre and begin to fail.</item>
        <item>O you bright-jewelled maid, if I forget (him) today, my shoulders will lose their beauty even in the other life and make my bracelets loose.</item>
        <item>still live by longing for the arrival of him who has gone out of love for victory and with valour as his guide.</item>
        <item>My heart is rid of its sorrow and swells with rapture to think of my absent lover returning with his love.</item>
        <item>May I look on my lover till I am satisfied and thereafter will vanish the sallowness of my slender shoulders.</item>
        <item>May my husband return some day; and then will I enjoy (him) so as to destroy all this agonizing sorrow.</item>
        <item>This malady (of lust) is manured by the talk of women and watered by the (harsh) words of my mother.</item>
        <item>Let the king fight and gain (victories); (but) let me be united to my wife and feast the evening.</item>
        <item>To those who suffer waiting for the day of return of their distant lovers one day is as long as seven days.</item>
        <item>After (my wife) has died of a broken heart, what good will there be if she is to receive me, has received me, or has even embraced me?.</item>
        <item>Though you would conceal (your feelings), your painted eyes would not, for, transgressing (their bounds), they tell (me) something.</item>
        <item>Unusually great is the female simplicity of your maid whose beauty fills my eyes and whose shoulders resemble the bamboo.</item>
        <item>There is something that is implied in the beauty of this woman, like the thread that is visible in a garland of gems.</item>
        <item>There is something in the unmatured smile of this maid like the fragrance that is contained in an unblossomed bud.</item>
        <item>The well-meant departure of her whose bangles are tight-fitting contains a remedy that can cure my great sorrow.</item>
        <item>The embrace that fills me with comfort and gladness is capable of enduring (my former) sorrow and meditating on his want of love.</item>
        <item>My bracelets have understood before me the (mental) separation of him who rules the cool seashore.</item>
        <item>It was but yesterday my lover departed (from me); and it is seven days since my complexion turned sallow.</item>
        <item>She looked at her bracelets, her tender shoulders, and her feet; this was what she did there (significantly).</item>
        <item>To express their love-sickness by their eyes and resort to begging bespeaks more than ordinary female excellence.</item>
        <item>To please by thought and cheer by sight is peculiar, not to liquor but lust.</item>
        <item>If women have a lust that exceeds even the measure of the palmyra fruit, they will not desire (to feign) dislike even as much as the millet.</item>
        <item>Though my eyes disregard me and do what is pleasing to my husband, still will they not be satisfied unless they see him.</item>
        <item>O my friend! I was prepared to feign displeasure but my mind forgetting it was ready to embrace him.</item>
        <item>Like the eyes which see not the pencil that paints it, I cannot see my husband\'s fault (just) when I meet him.</item>
        <item>When I see my husband, I do not see any faults; but when I do not see him, I do not see anything but faults.</item>
        <item>Like those who leap into a stream which they know will carry them off, why should a wife feign dislike which she knows cannot hold out long?.</item>
        <item>O you rogue! your breast is to me what liquor is to those who rejoice in it, though it only gives them an unpleasant disgrace.</item>
        <item>Sexual delight is more delicate than a flower, and few are those who understand its real nature.</item>
        <item>She once feigned dislike in her eyes, but the warmth of her embrace exceeded my own.</item>
        <item>O my soul! although you have seen how his soul stands by him, how is it you do not stand by me?</item>
        <item>my soul! although you have known him who does not love me, still do you go to him, saying "he will not be displeased.".</item>
        <item>O my soul! do you follow him at pleasure under the belief that the ruined have no friends?.</item>
        <item>O my soul! you would not first seem sulky and then enjoy (him); who then would in future consult you about such things?.</item>
        <item>My soul fears when it is without him; it also fears when it is with him; it is subject to incessant sorrow.</item>
        <item>My mind has been (here) in order to eat me up (as it were) whenever I think of him in my solitude.</item>
        <item>I have even forgotten my modesty, having been caught in my foolish mind which is not dignified enough to forget him.</item>
        <item>My soul which clings to life thinks only of his (own) gain in the belief that it would be disgraceful for it to despise him.</item>
        <item>Who would help me out of one\'s distress, when one\'s own soul refuses help to one? .</item>
        <item>It is hardly possible for strangers to behave like relations, when one\'s own soul acts like a stranger.</item>
        <item>Let us witness awhile his keen suffering; just feign dislike and embrace him not.</item>
        <item>A little dislike is like salt in proportion; to prolong it a little is like salt a little too much.</item>
        <item>For men not to embrace those who have feigned dislike is like torturing those already in agony.</item>
        <item>Not to reconcile those who have feigned dislike is like cutting a faded creeper at its root.</item>
        <item>An increased shyness in those whose eyes are like flowers is beautiful even to good and virtuous husbands.</item>
        <item>Sexual pleasure, without prolonged and short-lived dislike, is like too ripe, and unripe fruit.</item>
        <item>The doubt as to whether intercourse would take place soon or not, creates a sorrow (even) in feigned dislike.</item>
        <item>What avails sorrow when I am without a wife who can understand the cause of my sorrow?.</item>
        <item>Like water in the shade, dislike is delicious only in those who love.</item>
        <item>It is nothing but strong desire that makes her mind unite with me who can leave her to her own dislike.</item>
        <item>You are given to prostitution; all those who are born as womankind enjoy you with their eyes in an ordinary way. I will not embrace you.</item>
        <item>When I continued to be sulky he sneezed and thought I would (then) wish him a long life.</item>
        <item>Even if I were adorned with a garland of branch-flowers, she would say I did so to show it to another woman.</item>
        <item>When I said I loved her more than any other woman, she said "more than others, yes, more than others," and remained sulky.</item>
        <item>When I said I would never part from her in this life her eyes were filled with tears.</item>
        <item>When I said I had remembered her, she said I had forgotten her and relaxing her embrace, began to feign dislike.</item>
        <item>When I sneezed she blessed me, but at once changed (her mind) and wept, asking, "At the thought of whom did you sneeze?".</item>
        <item>When I suppressed my sneezing, she wept saying, "I suppose you (did so) to hide from me your own people\'s remembrance of you".</item>
        <item>Even when I try to remove her dislike, she is displeased and says, "This is the way you behave towards (other women)."</item>
        <item>Even when I look on her contemplating (her beauty), she is displeased and says, "With whose thought have you (thus) looked on my person?".</item>
        <item>Although my husband is free from defects, the way in which he embraces me is such as to make me feign dislike.</item>
        <item>His love will increase though it may (at first seem to) fade through the short-lived distress caused by (my) dislike.</item>
        <item>Is there a celestial land that can please like the feigned dislike of those whose union resembles that of earth and water?.</item>
        <item>In prolonged dislike after an embrace there is a weapon that can break my heart.</item>
        <item>Though free from defects, men feel pleased when they cannot embrace the delicate shoulders of those whom they love.</item>
        <item>To digest what has been eaten is more delightful than to eat more; likewise love is more delightful in dislike than intercourse.</item>
        <item>Those are conquerors whose dislike has been defeated and that is proved by the love (which follows).</item>
        <item>Will I enjoy once more through her dislike, the pleasure of that love that makes her forehead perspire?.</item>
        <item>May the bright-jewelled one feign dislike, and may the night be prolonged for me to implore her!.</item>
        <item>Dislike adds delight to love; and a hearty embrace (thereafter) will add delight to dislike.</item>
