            <item>To sire, what best requital can by grateful child be done?
To make men say, \'What merit gained the father such a son?\' </item>
            <item>And is there bar that can even love restrain?

            <item>The loveless to themselves belong alone;

            <item>Sweetness on earth and rarest bliss above,
These are the fruits of tranquil life of love </item>
            <item>The unwise deem love virtue only can sustain,
It also helps the man who evil would restrain </item>
            <item>As sun\'s fierce ray dries up the boneless things,
So loveless beings virtue\'s power to nothing brings </item>
            <item>The loveless soul, the very joys of life may know,
When flowers, in barren soil, on sapless trees, shall blow </item>
            <item>Though every outward part complete, the body\'s fitly framed;
What good, when soul within, of love devoid, lies halt and maimed </item>
            <item>Bodies of loveless men are bony framework clad with skin;
Then is the body seat of life, when love resides within </item>
            <item>All household cares and course of daily life have this in view
Guests to receive with courtesy, and kindly acts to do </item>
            <item>Though food of immortality should crown the board,
Feasting alone, the guests without unfed, is thing abhorred </item>
            <item>Each day he tends the coming guest with kindly care;
Painless, unfailing plenty shall his household share </item>
            <item>With smiling face he entertains each virtuous guest,
\'Fortune\' with gladsome mind shall in his dwelling rest </item>
            <item>Who first regales his guest, and then himself supplies,
O\'er all his fields, unsown, shall plenteous harvests rise </item>
            <item>The guest arrived he tends, the coming guest expects to see;
To those in heavenly homes that dwell a welcome guest is he </item>
            <item>To reckon up the fruit of kindly deeds were all in vain;
Their worth is as the worth of guests you entertain </item>
            <item>With pain they guard their stores, yet \'All forlorn are we,\' they\'ll cry,
Who cherish not their guests, nor kindly help supply </item>
            <item>To turn from guests is penury, though worldly goods abound;
\'Tis senseless folly, only with the senseless found </item>
            <item>The flower of \'Anicha\' withers away, If you do but its fragrance inhale;
If the face of the host cold welcome convey, The guest\'s heart within him will fail </item>
            <item>Pleasant words are words with all pervading love that burn;
Words from his guileless mouth who can the very truth discern </item>
            <item>A pleasant word with beaming smile\'s preferred,
Even to gifts with liberal heart conferred </item>
            <item>With brightly beaming smile, and kindly light of loving eye,
And heart sincere, to utter pleasant words is charity </item>
            <item>The men of pleasant speech that gladness breathe around,
Through indigence shall never sorrow\'s prey be found </item>
            <item>Humility with pleasant speech to man on earth,
Is choice adornment; all besides is nothing worth </item>
            <item>Who seeks out good, words from his lips of sweetness flow;
In him the power of vice declines, and virtues grow </item>
            <item>The words of sterling sense, to rule of right that strict adhere,
To virtuous action prompting, blessings yield in every sphere </item>
            <item>Sweet kindly words, from meanness free, delight of heart,
In world to come and in this world impart </item>
            <item>Who sees the pleasure kindly speech affords,
Why makes he use of harsh, repellant words </item>
            <item>When pleasant words are easy, bitter words to use,
Is, leaving sweet ripe fruit, the sour unripe to choose </item>
            <item>Assistance given by those who ne\'er received our aid,
Is debt by gift of heaven and earth but poorly paid </item>
            <item>A timely benefit, -though thing of little worth,
The gift itself, -in excellence transcends the earth </item>
            <item>Kindness shown by those who weigh not what the return may be:
When you ponder right its merit, \'Tis vaster than the sea </item>
            <item>Each benefit to those of actions\' fruit who rightly deem,
Though small as millet-seed, as palm-tree vast will seem </item>
            <item>The kindly aid\'s extent is of its worth no measure true;
Its worth is as the worth of him to whom the act you do </item>
            <item>Kindness of men of stainless soul remember evermore
Forsake thou never friends who were thy stay in sorrow sore </item>
            <item>Through all seven worlds, in seven-fold birth, Remains in mem\'ry of the wise
Friendship of those who wiped on earth, The tears of sorrow from their eyes </item>
            <item>\'Tis never good to let the thought of good things done thee pass away;
Of things not good, \'tis good to rid thy memory that very day </item>
            <item>Effaced straightway is deadliest injury,
By thought of one kind act in days gone by </item>
            <item>Who every good have killed, may yet destruction flee;
Who \'benefit\' has killed, that man shall ne\'er \'scape free </item>
            <item>If justice, failing not, its quality maintain,
Giving to each his due, -\'tis man\'s one highest gain </item>
            <item>The just man\'s wealth unwasting shall endure,
And to his race a lasting joy ensure </item>

By each one\'s offspring shall the truth be clear </item>
            <item>The gain and loss in life are not mere accident;
Just mind inflexible is sages\' ornament </item>
            <item>If, right deserting, heart to evil turn,
Let man impending ruin\'s sign discern </item>
            <item>The man who justly lives, tenacious of the right,
In low estate is never low to wise man\'s sight </item>
            <item>To stand, like balance-rod that level hangs and rightly weighs,
With calm unbiassed equity of soul, is sages\' praise </item>
            <item>Inflexibility in word is righteousness,
If men inflexibility of soul possess </item>
            <item>As thriving trader is the trader known,
Who guards another\'s interests as his own </item>
            <item>Control of self does man conduct to bliss th\' immortals share;
Indulgence leads to deepest night, and leaves him there </item>
            <item>Guard thou as wealth the power of self-control;
Than this no greater gain to living soul </item>

With wife of sure confiding friend who evil things devise </item>
            <item>How great soe\'er they be, what gain have they of life,
Who, not a whit reflecting, seek a neighbour\'s wife </item>
            <item>\'Mere triflel\' saying thus, invades the home, so he ensures
A gain of guilt that deathless aye endures </item>

The men who touch not her that is another\'s bride.</item>

At least, \'tis good if neighbour\'s wife he covet not.</item>
            <item>As earth bears up the men who delve into her breast,
To bear with scornful men of virtues is the best.</item>
            <item>Forgiving trespasses is good always;
Forgetting them hath even higher praise;.</item>
            <item>The sorest poverty is bidding guest unfed depart;
The mightiest might to bear with men of foolish heart.</item>
            <item>Seek\'st thou honour never tarnished to retain;

            <item>Who wreak their wrath as worthless are despised;

Knowing ill-deeds of foul disgrace the cause.</item>
            <item>Envy they have within! Enough to seat their fate!
Though foemen fail, envy can ruin consummate..</item>
            <item>Who scans good gifts to others given with envious eye,
His kin, with none to clothe or feed them, surely die.</item>
            <item>From envious man good fortune\'s goddess turns away,
Grudging him good, and points him out misfortune\'s prey.</item>
            <item>Envy, embodied ill, incomparable bane,
Good fortune slays, and soul consigns to fiery pain.</item>
            <item>To men of envious heart, when comes increase of joy,
Or loss to blameless men, the \'why\' will thoughtful hearts employ.</item>
            <item>No envious men to large and full felicity attain;
No men from envy free have failed a sure increase to gain.</item>
            <item>With soul unjust to covet others\' well-earned store,
Brings ruin to the home, to evil opes the door.</item>
            <item>Through lust of gain, no deeds that retribution bring,
Do they, who shrink with shame from every unjust thing.</item>
            <item>No deeds of ill, misled by base desire,
Do they, whose souls to other joys aspire.</item>
            <item>Men who have conquered sense, with sight from sordid vision freed,
Desire not other\'s goods, e\'en in the hour of sorest need.</item>
            <item>What gain, though lore refined of amplest reach he learn,
His acts towards all mankind if covetous desire to folly turn?.</item>
            <item>Though, grace desiring, he in virtue\'s way stand strong,
He\'s lost who wealth desires, and ponders deeds of wrong.</item>
            <item>Seek not increase by greed of gain acquired;
That fruit matured yields never good desired.</item>
            <item>What saves prosperity from swift decline?
Absence of lust to make another\'s cherished riches thine!.</item>
            <item>Good fortune draws anigh in helpful time of need,
To him who, schooled in virtue, guards his soul from greed.</item>
            <item>From thoughtless lust of other\'s goods springs fatal ill,
Greatness of soul that covets not shall triumph still.</item>
            <item>Though virtuous words his lips speak not, and all his deeds are ill.
If neighbour he defame not, there\'s good within him still.</item>
            <item>Than he who virtue scorns, and evil deeds performs, more vile,
Is he that slanders friend, then meets him with false smile.</item>
            <item>\'Tis greater gain of virtuous good for man to die,
Than live to slander absent friend, and falsely praise when nigh.</item>
            <item>In presence though unkindly words you speak, say not
In absence words whose ill result exceeds your thought.</item>
            <item>The slanderous meanness that an absent friend defames,
\'This man in words owns virtue, not in heart,\' proclaims.</item>
            <item>Who on his neighbours\' sins delights to dwell,
The story of his sins, culled out with care, the world will tell.</item>
            <item>With friendly art who know not pleasant words to say,
Speak words that sever hearts, and drive choice friends away.</item>
            <item>Whose nature bids them faults of closest friends proclaim
What mercy will they show to other men\'s good name?.</item>
            <item>\'Tis charity, I ween, that makes the earth sustain their load.
Who, neighbours\' absence watching, tales or slander tell abroad.</item>
            <item>If each his own, as neighbours\' faults would scan,
Could any evil hap to living man?.</item>
            <item>Words without sense, while chafe the wise,
Who babbles, him will all despise.</item>
            <item>Words without sense, where many wise men hear, to pour
Than deeds to friends ungracious done offendeth more.</item>
            <item>Diffusive speech of useless words proclaims
A man who never righteous wisdom gains.</item>
            <item>Unmeaning, worthless words, said to the multitude,
To none delight afford, and sever men from good.</item>
            <item>Gone are both fame and boasted excellence,
When men of worth speak of words devoid of sense.</item>
            <item>Who makes display of idle words\' inanity,
Call him not man, -chaff of humanity!.</item>
            <item>Let those who list speak things that no delight afford,
\'Tis good for men of worth to speak no idle word.</item>
            <item>The wise who weigh the worth of every utterance,
Speak none but words of deep significance.</item>
            <item>The men of vision pure, from wildering folly free,
Not e\'en in thoughtless hour, speak words of vanity.</item>
            <item>If speak you will, speak words that fruit afford,
If speak you will, speak never fruitless word.</item>
            <item>With sinful act men cease to feel the dread of ill within,
The excellent will dread the wanton pride of cherished sin.</item>
            <item>Since evils new from evils ever grow,
Evil than fire works out more dreaded woe.</item>
            <item>Even to those that hate make no return of ill;

Affliction sore through ill to thee by others done.</item>
            <item>From every enmity incurred there is to \'scape, a way;

Destruction thus on sinful deeds attends.</item>
            <item>Beware, if to thyself thyself is dear,
Lest thou to aught that ranks as ill draw near!.</item>
            <item>The man, to devious way of sin that never turned aside,
From ruin rests secure, whatever ills betide.</item>
            <item>Duty demands no recompense; to clouds of heaven,

            <item>The worthy say, when wealth rewards their toil-spent hours,
For uses of beneficence alone \'tis ours.</item>
            <item>To \'due beneficence\' no equal good we know,
Amid the happy gods, or in this world below.</item>

Is as when water fills the lake that village needs supplies.</item>
            <item>A tree that fruits in th\' hamlet\'s central mart,
Is wealth that falls to men of liberal heart.</item>
            <item>Unfailing tree that healing balm distils from every part,
Is ample wealth that falls to him of large and noble heart.</item>
            <item>E\'en when resources fall, they weary not of \'kindness due,\'-
They to whom Duty\'s self appears in vision true.</item>
            <item>The kindly-hearted man is poor in this alone,
When power of doing deeds of goodness he finds none.</item>
            <item>Though by \'beneficence,\' the loss of all should come,
\'Twere meet man sold himself, and bought it with the sum.</item>
            <item>Call that a gift to needy men thou dost dispense,
All else is void of good, seeking for recompense.</item>
            <item>Though men declare it heavenward path, yet to receive is ill;
Though upper heaven were not, to give is virtue still.</item>
            <item>\'I\'ve nought\' is ne\'er the high-born man\'s reply;
He gives to those who raise themselves that cry.</item>
            <item>The suppliants\' cry for aid yields scant delight,
Until you see his face with grateful gladness bright.</item>
            <item>\'Mid devotees they\'re great who hunger\'s pangs sustain,

The hand of hunger\'s sickness sore shall never feel.</item>
            <item>Delight of glad\'ning human hearts with gifts do they not know.
Men of unpitying eye, who hoard their wealth and lose it so?.</item>
            <item>They keep their garners full, for self alone the board they spread;-
\'Tis greater pain, be sure, than begging daily bread!.</item>
            <item>\'Tis bitter pain to die, \'Tis worse to live.
For him who nothing finds to give!.</item>
            <item>See that thy life the praise of generous gifts obtain;

Nought lives on earth that shall not die.</item>
            <item>If men do virtuous deeds by world-wide ample glory crowned,
The heavens will cease to laud the sage for other gifts renowned.</item>

Are fruits which only wisdom rare can yield.</item>

            <item>AGain of true wealth oblivious they eschew,
Who \'grace\' forsake, and graceless actions do.</item>
            <item>As to impoverished men this present world is not;
The \'graceless\' in you world have neither part nor lot.</item>
            <item>Who lose the flower of wealth, when seasons change, again may bloom;
Who lose \'benevolence\', lose all; nothing can change their doom.</item>

            <item>No use of wealth have they who guard not their estate;
No use of grace have they with flesh who hunger sate.</item>
            <item>Like heart of them that murderous weapons bear, his mind,
Who eats of savoury meat, no joy in good can find.</item>
            <item>\'What\'s grace, or lack of grace\'? \'To kill\' is this, that \'not to kill\';
To eat dead flesh can never worthy end fulfil.</item>
            <item>If flesh you eat not, life\'s abodes unharmed remain;
Who eats, hell swallows him, and renders not again.</item>
            <item>\'We eat the slain,\' you say, by us no living creatures die;
Who\'d kill and sell, I pray, if none came there the flesh to buy?</item>
            <item>With other beings\' ulcerous wounds their hunger they appease;

            <item>Whose souls the vision pure and passionless perceive,

            <item>Than thousand rich oblations, with libations rare,

            <item>To bear due penitential pains, while no offence
He causes others, is the type of \'penitence\'.</item>

Where that is not, \'tis but a vain pretence.</item>
            <item>Have other men forgotten \'penitence\' who strive
To earn for penitents the things by which they live?.</item>
            <item>Destruction to his foes, to friends increase of joy.
The \'penitent\' can cause, if this his thoughts employ.</item>
            <item>That what they wish may, as they wish, be won,
By men on earth are works of painful \'penance\' done.</item>
            <item>Who works of \'penance\' do, their end attain,
Others in passion\'s net enshared, toil but in vain.</item>
            <item>The hotter glows the fining fire, the gold the brighter shines;
The pain of penitence, like fire, the soul of man refines.</item>

Him worships every other living soul.</item>
            <item>The E\'en over death the victory he may gain,
If power by penance won his soul obtain.</item>
            <item>The many all things lack! The cause is plain,
The \'penitents\' are few. The many shun such pain.</item>
            <item>Who with deceitful mind in false way walks of covert sin,
The five-fold elements his frame compose, decide within.</item>
            <item>What gain, though virtue\'s semblance high as heaven his fame exalt,
If heart dies down through sense of self-detected fault?.</item>
            <item>As if a steer should graze wrapped round with tiger\'s skin,
Is show of virtuous might when weakness lurks within.</item>
            <item>\'Tis as a fowler, silly birds to snare, in thicket lurks.
When, clad in stern ascetic garb, one secret evil works.</item>
            <item>\'Our souls are free,\' who say, yet practise evil secretly,
\'What folly have we wrought!\' by many shames o\'er-whelmed, shall cry.</item>
            <item>In mind renouncing nought, in speech renouncing every tie,
Who guileful live,- no men are found than these of \'harder eye\'.</item>
            <item>Outward, they shine as \'kunri\' berry\'s scarlet bright;
Inward, like tip of \'kunri\' bead, as black as night.</item>
            <item>Many wash in hollowed waters, living lives of hidden shame;
Foul in heart, yet high upraised of men in virtuous fame.</item>
            <item>Cruel is the arrow straight, the crooked lute is sweet,
Judge by their deeds the many forms of men you meet.</item>
            <item>What\'s the worth of shaven head or tresses long,
If you shun what all the world condemns as wrong?.</item>
            <item>Who seeks heaven\'s joys, from impious levity secure,
Let him from every fraud preserve his spirit pure.</item>
            <item>\'Tis sin if in the mind man but thought conceive;
\'By fraud I will my neighbour of his wealth bereave\'.</item>
            <item>The gain that comes by fraud, although it seems to grow
With limitless increase, to ruin swift shall go.</item>
            <item>The lust inveterate of fraudful gain,
Yields as its fruit undying pain.</item>
            <item>\'Grace\' is not in their thoughts, nor know they kind affection\'s power,
Who neighbour\'s goods desire, and watch for his unguarded hour.</item>
            <item>They cannot walk restrained in wisdom\'s measured bound,
In whom inveterate lust of fraudful gain is found.</item>
            <item>Practice of fraud\'s dark cunning arts they shun,
Who long for power by \'measured wisdom\' won.</item>
            <item>As virtue dwells in heart that \'measured wisdom\' gains;
Deceit in hearts of fraudful men established reigns.</item>
            <item>Who have no lore save that which fraudful arts supply,
Acts of unmeasured vice committing straightway die.</item>
            <item>The fraudful forfeit life and being here below;
Who fraud eschew the bliss of heavenly beings know.</item>
            <item>You ask, in lips of men what \'truth\' may be;
\'Tis speech from every taint of evil free.</item>
            <item>Falsehood may take the place of truthful word,
If blessing, free from fault, it can afford.</item>
            <item>Speak not a word which false thy own heart knows
Self-kindled fire within the false one\'s spirit glows.</item>
            <item>True to his inmost soul who lives,- enshrined
He lives in souls of all mankind.</item>
            <item>Greater is he who speaks the truth with full consenting mind.
Than men whose lives have penitence and charity combined.</item>
            <item>No praise like that of words from falsehood free;
This every virtue yields spontaneously.</item>
            <item>If all your life be utter truth, the truth alone,
\'Tis well, though other virtuous acts be left undone.</item>
            <item>Outward purity the water will bestow;
Inward purity from truth alone will flow.</item>
            <item>Every lamp is not a lamp in wise men\'s sight;
That\'s the lamp with truth\'s pure radiance bright.</item>
            <item>Of all good things we\'ve scanned with studious care,
There\'s nought that can with truthfulness compare.</item>
            <item>Where thou hast power thy angry will to work, thy wrath restrain;
Where power is none, what matter if thou check or give it rein?.</item>
            <item>Where power is none to wreak thy wrath, wrath importent is ill;
Where thou hast power thy will to work, \'tis greater, evil still.</item>
            <item>If any rouse thy wrath, the trespass straight forget;
For wrath an endless train of evils will beget.</item>
            <item>Wrath robs the face of smiles, the heart of joy,
What other foe to man works such annoy?.</item>
            <item>If thou would\'st guard thyself, guard against wrath alway;
\'Gainst wrath who guards not, him his wrath shall slay.</item>
            <item>Wrath, the fire that slayeth whose draweth near,
Will burn the helpful \'raft\' of kindred dear.</item>
            <item>The hand that smites the earth unfailing feels the sting;
So perish they who nurse their wrath as noble thing.</item>
            <item>Though men should work thee woe, like touch of tongues of fire.
\'Tis well if thou canst save thy soul from burning ire.</item>
            <item>If man his soul preserve from wrathful fires,
He gains with that whate\'er his soul desires.</item>
            <item>Men of surpassing wrath are like the men who\'ve passed away;
Who wrath renounce, equals of all-renouncing sages they.</item>
            <item>Though ill to neighbour wrought should glorious pride of wealth secure,
No ill to do is fixed decree of men in spirit pure.</item>
            <item>Though malice work its worst, planning no ill return, to endure,
And work no ill, is fixed decree of men in spirit pure.</item>
            <item>Though unprovoked thy soul malicious foes should sting,
Retaliation wrought inevitable woes will bring.</item>
            <item>To punish wrong, with kindly benefits the doers ply;
Thus shame their souls; but pass the ill unheeded by.</item>
            <item>From wisdom\'s vaunted lore what doth the learner gain,
If as his own he guard not others\' souls from pain?.</item>
            <item>What his own soul has felt as bitter pain,
From making others feel should man abstain.</item>
            <item>To work no wilful woe, in any wise, through all the days,
To any living soul, is virtue\'s highest praise.</item>
            <item>Whose soul has felt the bitter smart of wrong, how can
He wrongs inflict on ever-living soul of man?.</item>
            <item>If, ere the noontide, you to others evil do,
Before the eventide will evil visit you.</item>
            <item>O\'er every evil-doer evil broodeth still;
He evil shuns who freedom seeks from ill.</item>
            <item>What is the work of virtue? \'Not to kill\';
For \'killing\' leads to every work of ill.</item>
            <item>Let those that need partake your meal; guard every-thing that lives;
This the chief and sum of lore that hoarded wisdom gives.</item>
            <item>Alone, first of goods things, is \'not to slay\';
The second is, no untrue word to say.</item>
            <item>You ask, What is the good and perfect way?
\'Tis path of him who studies nought to slay.</item>
            <item>Of those who \'being\' dread, and all renounce, the chief are they,
Who dreading crime of slaughter, study nought to slay.</item>
            <item>Ev\'n death that life devours, their happy days shall spare,
Who law, \'Thou shall not kill\', uphold with reverent care.</item>
            <item>Though thine own life for that spared life the price must pay,
Take not from aught that lives gift of sweet life away.</item>
            <item>Though great the gain of good should seem, the wise
Will any gain by staughter won despise.</item>
            <item>Whose trade is \'killing\', always vile they show,
To minds of them who what is vileness know.</item>
            <item>Who lead a loathed life in bodies sorely pained,
Are men, the wise declare, by guilt of slaughter stained.</item>
            <item>Lowest and meanest lore, that bids men trust secure,
In things that pass away, as things that shall endure!.</item>
            <item>As crowds round dancers fill the hall, is wealth\'s increase;
Its loss, as throngs dispersing, when the dances cease.</item>
            <item>Unenduring is all wealth; if you wealth enjoy,
Enduring works in working wealth straightway employ.</item>
            <item>As \'day\' it vaunts itself; well understood, \'tis knife\',
That daily cuts away a portion from thy life.</item>
            <item>Before the tongue lie powerless, \'mid the gasp of gurgling breath,
Arouse thyself, and do good deeds beyond the power of death.</item>
            <item>Existing yesterday, today to nothing hurled!-
Such greatness owns this transitory world.</item>
            <item>Who know not if their happy lives shall last the day,
In fancies infinite beguile the hours away!.</item>
            <item>Birds fly away, and leave the nest deserted bare;
Such is the short-lived friendship soul and body share.</item>
            <item>Death is sinking into slumbers deep;
Birth again is waking out of sleep.</item>
            <item>The soul in fragile shed as lodger courts repose:-
Is it because no home\'s conclusive rest it knows?.</item>
            <item>From whatever, aye, whatever, man gets free,
From what, aye, from that, no more of pain hath he!.</item>
            <item>\'Renunciation\' made- ev\'n here true pleasures men acquire;
\'Renounce\' while time is yet, if to those pleasures you aspire.</item>
            <item>\'Perceptions of the five\' must all expire;-
Relinquished in its order each desire.</item>
            <item>\'Privation absolute\' is penance true;
\'Possession\' brings bewilderment anew.</item>
            <item>To those who sev\'rance seek from being\'s varied strife,
Flesh is burthen sore; what then other bonds of life?.</item>
            <item>Who kills conceit that utters \'I\' and \'mine\',
Shall enter realms above the powers divine.</item>
            <item>Who cling to things that cling and eager clasp,
Griefs cling to them with unrelaxing grasp.</item>
            <item>Who thoroughly \'renounce\' on highest height are set;
The rest bewildered, lie entangled in the net.</item>
            <item>When that which clings falls off, severed is being\'s tie;
All else will then be seen as instability.</item>
            <item>Cling thou to that which He, to Whom nought clings, hath bid thee cling,
Cling to that bond, to get thee free from every clinging thing.</item>
            <item>Of things devoid of truth as real things men deem;-
Cause of degraded birth the fond delusive dream!.</item>
            <item>Darkness departs, and rapture springs to men who see,
The mystic vision pure, from all delusion free.</item>
            <item>When doubts disperse, and mists of error roll
Away, nearer is heav\'n than earth to sage\'s soul.</item>
            <item>Five-fold perception gained, what benefits accrue
To them whose spirits lack perception of the true?.</item>
            <item>Whatever thing, of whatsoever kind it be,
\'Tis wisdom\'s part in each the very thing to see.</item>
            <item>Who learn, and here the knowledge of the true obtain,
Shall find the path that hither cometh not again.</item>
            <item>The mind that knows with certitude what is, and ponders well,
Its thoughts on birth again to other life need not to dwell.</item>
            <item>When folly, cause of births, departs; and soul can view
The truth of things, man\'s dignity- \'tis wisdom true.</item>
            <item>The true \'support\' who knows- rejects \'supports\' he sought before-
Sorrow that clings all destroys, shall cling to him no more.</item>
            <item>When lust and wrath and error\'s triple tyranny is o\'er,
Their very names for aye extinct, then pain shall be no more.</item>
            <item>The wise declare, through all the days, to every living thing.
That ceaseless round of birth from seed of strong desire doth spring.</item>
            <item>If desire you feel, freedom from changing birth require!
\'I\' will come, if you desire to \'scape, set free from all desire.</item>
            <item>No glorious wealth is here like freedom from desire;
To bliss like this not even there can soul aspire.</item>
            <item>Desire\'s decease as purity men know;
That, too, from yearning search for truth will grow.</item>
            <item>Men freed from bonds of strong desire are free;
None other share such perfect liberty.</item>
            <item>Desire each soul beguiles;
True virtue dreads its wiles.</item>
            <item>Who thoroughly rids his life of passion-prompted deed,
Deeds of unfailing worth shall do, which, as he plans, succeed.</item>
            <item>Affliction is not known where no desires abide;
Where these are, endless rises sorrow\'s tide.</item>
            <item>When dies away desire, that woe of woes
Ev\'n here the soul unceasing rapture knows.</item>
            <item>Drive from thy soul desire insatiate;
Straight\'way is gained the moveless blissful state.</item>
            <item>Wealth-giving fate power of unflinching effort brings;
From fate that takes away idle remissness springs.</item>
            <item>The fate that loss ordains makes wise men\'s wisdom foolishness;
The fate that gain bestows with ampler powers will wisdom bless.</item>
            <item>In subtle learning manifold though versed man be,
\'The wisdom, truly his, will gain supremacy.</item>
            <item>Two fold the fashion of the world: some live in fortune\'s light;
While other some have souls in wisdom\'s radiance bright.</item>
            <item>All things that good appear will oft have ill success;
All evil things prove good for gain of happiness.</item>
            <item>Things not your own will yield no good, howe\'er you guard with pain;
Your own, howe\'er you scatter them abroad, will yours remain.</item>
            <item>Save as the \'sharer\' shares to each in due degree,
To those who millions store enjoyment scarce can be.</item>
            <item>The destitute with ascetics merit share,
If fate to visit with predestined ills would spare.</item>
            <item>When good things come, men view them all as gain;
When evils come, why then should they complain?.</item>
            <item>What powers so great as those of Destiny? Man\'s skill
Some other thing contrives; but fate\'s beforehand still.</item>
            <item>An army, people, wealth, a minister, friends, fort: six things-
Who owns them all, a lion lives amid the kings.</item>
            <item>Courage, a liberal hand, wisdom, and energy: these four
Are qualities a king adorn for evermore.</item>
            <item>A sleepless promptitude, knowledge, decision strong:
These three for aye to rulers of the land belong.</item>
            <item>Kingship, in virtue failing not, all vice restrains,
In courage failing not, it honour\'s grace maintains.</item>
            <item>A king is he who treasure gains, stores up, defends,
And duly for his kingdom\'s weal expends.</item>
            <item>Where king is easy of access, where no harsh word repels,
That land\'s high praises every subject swells.</item>
            <item>With pleasant speech, who gives and guards with powerful liberal hand,
He sees the world obedient all to his command.</item>
            <item>Who guards the realm and justice strict maintains,
That king as god o\'er subject people reigns.</item>
            <item>The king of worth, who can words bitter to his ear endure,
Beneath the shadow of his power the world abides secure.</item>
            <item>Gifts, grace, right sceptre, care of people\'s weal;
These four a light of dreaded kings reveal.</item>
            <item>So learn that you may full and faultless learning gain,
Then in obedience meet to lessons learnt remain.</item>
            <item>The twain that lore of numbers and of letters give
Are eyes, the wise declare, to all on earth that live.</item>
            <item>Men who learning gain have eyes, men say;
Blockheads\' faces pairs of sores display.</item>
            <item>You meet with joy, with pleasant thought you part;
Such is the learned scholar\'s wonderous art!.</item>
            <item>With soul submiss they stand, as paupers front a rich man\'s face;
Yet learned men are first; th\'unlearned stand in lowest place.</item>
            <item>In sandy soil, when deep you delve, you reach the springs below;
The more you learn, the freer streams of wisdom flow.</item>
            <item>The learned make each land their own, in every city find a home;
Who, till they die; learn nought, along what weary ways they roam!.</item>
            <item>The man who store of learning gains,
In one, through seven worlds, bliss attains.</item>
            <item>Their joy is joy of all the world, they see; thus more
The learners learn to love their cherished lore.</item>
            <item>Learning is excellence of wealth that none destroy;
To man nought else affords reality of joy.</item>
            <item>Like those at draughts would play without the chequered square,
Men void of ample lore would counsels of the learned share.</item>
            <item>Like those who doat on hoyden\'s undeveloped charms are they,
Of learning void, who eagerly their power of words display.</item>
            <item>The blockheads, too, may men of worth appear,
If they can keep from speaking where the learned hear!.</item>
            <item>From blockheads\' lips, when words of wisdom glibly flow,
The wise receive them not, though good they seem to show.</item>
            <item>As worthless shows the worth of man unlearned,
When council meets, by words he speaks discerned.</item>
            <item>\'They are\': so much is true of men untaught;
But, like a barren field, they yield us nought!.</item>
            <item>Who lack the power of subtle, large, and penetrating sense,
Like puppet, decked with ornaments of clay, their beauty\'s vain pretence.</item>
            <item>To men unlearned, from fortune\'s favour greater-evil springs
Than poverty to men of goodly wisdom brings.</item>
            <item>Lower are men unlearned, though noble be their race,
Than low-born men adorned with learning\'s grace.</item>
            <item>Learning\'s irradiating grace who gain,
Others excel, as men the bestial train.</item>
            <item>Wealth of wealth is wealth acquired be ear attent;
Wealth mid all wealth supremely excellent.</item>
            <item>When \'tis no longer time the listening ear to feed
With trifling dole of food supply the body\'s need.</item>
            <item>Who feed their ear with learned teachings rare,
Are like the happy gods oblations rich who share.</item>
            <item>Though learning none hath he, yet let him hear alway:
In weakness this shall prove a staff and stay.</item>
            <item>Like staff in hand of him in slippery ground who strays
Are words from mouth of those who walk in righteous ways.</item>
            <item>Let each man good things learn, for e\'en as he
Shall learn, he gains increase of perfect dignity.</item>
            <item>Not e\'en through inadvertence speak they foolish word,
With clear discerning mind who\'ve learning\'s ample lessons heard.</item>
            <item>Where teaching hath not oped the learner\'s ear,
The man may listen, but he scarce can hear.</item>
            <item>\'Tis hard for mouth to utter gentle, modest word,
When ears discourse of lore refined have never heard.</item>
            <item>His mouth can taste, but ear no taste of joy can give!
What matter if he die, or prosperous live?.</item>
            <item>True wisdom wards off woes, A circling fortress high;
Its inner strength man\'s eager foes Unshaken will defy.</item>
            <item>Wisdom restrains, nor suffers mind to wander where it would;
From every evil calls it back, and guides in way of good.</item>
            <item>Though things diverse from divers sages\' lips we learn,
\'Tis wisdom\'s part in each the true thing to discern.</item>
            <item>Wisdom hath use of lucid speech, words that acceptance win,
And subtle sense of other men\'s discourse takes in.</item>
            <item>Wisdom embraces frank the world, to no caprice exposed;
Unlike the lotus flower, now opened wide, now petals strictly closed.</item>
            <item>As dwells the world, so with the world to dwell
In harmony- this is to wisely live and well.</item>
            <item>The wise discern, the foolish fail to see,
And minds prepare for things about to be.</item>
            <item>Folly meets fearful ills with fearless heart;
To fear where cause of fear exists is wisdom\'s part.</item>
            <item>The wise with watchful soul who coming ills foresee;
From coming evil\'s dreaded shock are free.</item>
            <item>The wise is rich, with ev\'ry blessing blest;
The fool is poor, of everything possessed.</item>
            <item>Who arrogance, and wrath, and littleness of low desire restrain,
To sure increase of lofty dignity attain.</item>
            <item>A niggard hand, o\'erweening self-regard, and mirth
Unseemly, bring disgrace to men of kingly brith.</item>
            <item>Though small as millet-seed the fault men deem;
As palm tree vast to those who fear disgrace \'twill seem.</item>
            <item>Freedom from faults is wealth; watch heedfully
\'Gainst these, for fault is fatal enmity.</item>
            <item>His joy who guards not \'gainst the coming evil day,
Like straw before the fire shall swift consume away.</item>
            <item>Faultless the king who first his own faults cures, and then
Permits himself to scan faults of other men.</item>
            <item>Who leaves undone what should be done, with niggard mind,
His wealth shall perish, leaving not a wrack behind.</item>
            <item>The greed of soul that avarice men call,
When faults are summed, is worst of all.</item>
            <item>Never indulge in self-complaisant mood,
Nor deed desire that yields no gain of good.</item>
            <item>If, to your foes unknown, you cherish what you love,
Counsels of men who wish you harm will harmless prove.</item>
            <item>As friends the men who virtue know, and riper wisdom share,
Their worth weighed well, the king should choose with care.</item>
            <item>Cherish the all-accomplished men as friends,
Whose skill the present ill removes, from coming ill defends.</item>
            <item>To cherish men of mighty soul, and make them all their own,
Of kingly treasures rare, as rarest gift is known.</item>
            <item>To live with men of greatness that their own excels,
As cherished friends, is greatest power that with a monarch dwells.</item>
            <item>The king, since counsellors are monarch\'s eyes,
Should counsellors select with counsel wise.</item>
            <item>The king, who knows to live with worthy men allied,
Has nought to fear from any foeman\'s pride.</item>
            <item>What power can work his fall, who faithful ministers
Employs, that thunder out reproaches when he errs.</item>
            <item>The king with none to censure him, bereft of safeguards all,
Though none his ruin work, shall surely ruined fall.</item>
            <item>Who owns no principal, can have no gain of usury;
Who lacks support of friends, knows no stability.</item>
            <item>Than hate of many foes incurred, works greater woe
Ten-fold, of worthy men the friendship to forego.</item>
            <item>The great of soul will mean association fear;
The mean of soul regard mean men as kinsmen dear.</item>
            <item>The waters\' virtues change with soil through which they flow;
As man\'s companionship so will his wisdom show.</item>
            <item>Perceptions manifold in men are of the mind alone;
The value of the man by his companionship is known.</item>
            <item>Man\'s wisdom seems the offspring of his mind;
\'Tis outcome of companionship we find.</item>
            <item>Both purity of mind, and purity of action clear,
Leaning no staff of pure companionship, to man draw near.</item>
            <item>From true pure-minded men a virtuous race proceeds;
To men of pure companionship belong no evil deeds.</item>
            <item>Goodness of mind to lives of men increaseth gain;
And good companionship doth all of praise obtain.</item>
            <item>To perfect men, though minds right good belong,
Yet good companionship is confirmation strong.</item>
            <item>Although to mental goodness joys of other life belong,
Yet good companionship is confirmation strong.</item>
            <item>Than good companionship no surer help we know;
Than bad companionship nought causes direr woe.</item>
            <item>Expenditure, return, and profit of the deed
In time to come; weigh these- than to the act proceed.</item>
            <item>With chosen friends deliberate; next use the private thought;
Then act. By those who thus proceed all works with ease are wrought.</item>
            <item>To risk one\'s all and lose, aiming at added gain,
Is rash affair, from which the wise abstain.</item>
            <item>A work of which the issue is not clear,
Begin not they reproachful scorn who fear.</item>
            <item>With plans not well matured to rise against your foe,
Is way to plant him out where he is sure to grow!.</item>
            <item>\'Tis ruin if man do an unbefitting thing;
Fit things to leave undone will equal ruin bring.</item>
            <item>Think, and then dare the deed! Who cry,
\'Deed dared, we\'ll think,\' disgraced shall be.</item>
            <item>On no right system if man toil and strive,
Though many men assist, no work can thrive.</item>
            <item>Though well the work be done, yet one mistake is made,
To habitudes of various men when no regard is paid.</item>
            <item>Plan and perform no work that others may despise;
What misbeseems a king the world will not approve as wise.</item>
            <item>The force the strife demands, the force he owns, the force of foes,
The force of friends; these should he weigh ere to the war he goes.</item>
            <item>Who know what can be wrought, with knowledge of the means, on this,
Their mind firm set, go forth, nought goes with them amiss.</item>
            <item>Ill-deeming of their proper powers, have many monarchs striven,
And midmost of unequal conflict fallen asunder riven.</item>
            <item>Who not agrees with those around, no moderation knows,
In self-applause indulging, swift to ruin goes.</item>
            <item>With peacock feathers light, you load the wain;
Yet, heaped too high, the axle snaps in twain.</item>
            <item>Who daring climbs, and would himself upraise
Beyond the branch\'s tip, with life the forfeit pays.</item>
            <item>With knowledge of the measure due, as virtue bids you give!
That is the way to guard your wealth, and seemly live.</item>
            <item>Incomings may be scant; but yet, no failure there,
If in expenditure you rightly learn to spare.</item>
            <item>Who prosperous lives and of enjoyment knows no bound,
His seeming wealth, departing, nowhere shall be found.</item>
            <item>Beneficence that measures not its bound of means,
Will swiftly bring to nought the wealth on which it leans.</item>
            <item>A crow will conquer owl in broad daylight;
The king that foes would crush, needs fitting time to fight.</item>
            <item>The bond binds fortune fast is ordered effort made,
Strictly observant still of favouring season\'s aid.</item>
            <item>Can any work be hard in very fact,
If men use fitting means in timely act?.</item>
            <item>The pendant world\'s dominion may be won,
In fitting time and place by action done.</item>
            <item>Who think the pendant world itself to subjugate,
With mind unruffled for the fitting time must wait.</item>
            <item>The men of mighty power their hidden energies repress,
As fighting ram recoils to rush on foe with heavier stress.</item>
            <item>The glorious once of wrath enkindled make no outward show,
At once; they bide their time, while hidden fires within them glow.</item>
            <item>If foes\' detested form they see, with patience let them bear;
When fateful hour at last they spy,- the head lies there.</item>
            <item>When hardest gain of opportunity at last is won,
With promptitude let hardest deed be done.</item>
            <item>As heron stands with folded wing, so wait in waiting hour;
As heron snaps its prey, when fortune smiles, put forth your power.</item>
            <item>Begin no work of war, depise no foe,
Till place where you can wholly circumvent you know.</item>
            <item>Though skill in war combine with courage tried on battle-field,
The added gain of fort doth great advantage yield.</item>
            <item>E\'en weak ones mightily prevail, if place of strong defence,
They find, protect themselves, and work their foes offence.</item>
            <item>The foes who thought to triumph, find their thoughts were vain,
If hosts advance, seize vantage ground, and thence the fight maintain.</item>
            <item>The crocodile prevails in its own flow of water wide,
If this it leaves, \'tis slain by anything beside.</item>
            <item>The lofty car, with mighty wheel, sails not o\'er watery main,
The boat that skims the sea, runs not on earth\'s hard plain.</item>
            <item>Save their own fearless might they need no other aid,
If in right place they fight, all due provision made.</item>
            <item>If lord of army vast the safe retreat assail
Of him whose host is small, his mightiest efforts fail.</item>
            <item>Though fort be none, and store of wealth they lack,
\'Tis hard a people\'s homesteads to attack!.</item>
            <item>The jackal slays, in miry paths of foot-betraying fen,
The elephant of fearless eye and tusks transfixing armed men.</item>
            <item>How treats he virtue, wealth and pleasure? How, when life\'s at stake,
Comports himself? This four-fold test of man will full assurance make.</item>
            <item>Of noble race, of faultless worth, of generous pride
That shrinks from shame or stain; in him may king confide.</item>
            <item>Though deeply learned, unflecked by fault, \'tis rare to see,
When closely scanned, a man from all unwisdom free.</item>
            <item>Weigh well the good of each, his failings closely scan,
As these or those prevail, so estimate the man.</item>
            <item>Of greatness and of meanness too,
The deeds of each are touchstone true.</item>
            <item>Beware of trusting men who have no kith of kin;
No bonds restrain such men, no shame deters from sin.</item>
            <item>By fond affection led who trusts in men of unwise soul,
Yields all his being up to folly\'s blind control.</item>
            <item>Who trusts an untried stranger, brings disgrace,
Remediless, on all his race.</item>
            <item>Trust no man whom you have not fully tried,
When tested, in his prudence proved confide.</item>
            <item>Trust where you have not tried, doubt of a friend to feel,
Once trusted, wounds inflict that nought can heal.</item>
            <item>Who good and evil scanning, ever makes the good his joy;
Such man of virtuous mood should king employ.</item>
            <item>Who swells the revenues, spreads plenty o\'er the land,
Seeks out what hinders progress, his the workman\'s hand.</item>
            <item>A loyal love with wisdom, clearness, mind from avarice free;
Who hath these four good gifts should ever trusted be.</item>
            <item>Even when tests of every kind are multiplied,
Full many a man proves otherwise, by action tried!.</item>
            <item>No specious fav\'rite should the king\'s commission bear,
But he that knows, and work performs with patient care.</item>
            <item>Let king first ask, \'Who shall the deed perform?\' and \'What the deed?\'
Of hour befitting both assured, let every work proceed.</item>
            <item>\'This man, this work shall thus work out,\' let thoughtful king command;
Then leave the matter wholly in his servant\'s hand.</item>
            <item>As each man\'s special aptitude is known,
Bid each man make that special work his own.</item>
            <item>Fortune deserts the king who ill can bear,
Informal friendly ways of men his tolls who share.</item>
            <item>Let king search out his servants\' deeds each day;
When these do right, the world goes rightly on its way.</item>
            <item>When wealth is fled, old kindness still to show,
Is kindly grace that only kinsmen know.</item>
            <item>The gift of kin\'s unfailing love bestows
Much gain of good, like flower that fadeless blows.</item>
            <item>His joy of life who mingles not with kinsmen gathered round,
Is lake where streams pour in, with no encircling bound.</item>
            <item>The profit gained by wealth\'s increase,
Is living compassed round by relatives in peace.</item>
            <item>Who knows the use of pleasant words, and liberal gifts can give,
Connections, heaps of them, surrounding him shall live.</item>
            <item>Than one who gifts bestows and wrath restrains,
Through the wide world none larger following gains.</item>
            <item>The crows conceal not, call their friends to come, then eat;
Increase of good such worthy ones shall meet.</item>
            <item>Where king regards not all alike, but each in his degree,
\'Neath such discerning rule many dwell happily.</item>
            <item>Who once were his, and then forsook him, as before
Will come around, when cause of disagreement is no more.</item>
            <item>Who causeless went away, then to return, for any cause, ask leave;
The king should sift their motives well, consider, and receive!.</item>
            <item>\'Tis greater ill, it rapture of o\'erweening gladness to the soul
Bring self-forgetfulness than if transcendent wrath control.</item>
            <item>Perpetual, poverty is death to wisdom of the wise;
When man forgets himself his glory dies!.</item>
            <item>\'To self-oblivious men no praise\'; this rule
Decisive wisdom sums of every school.</item>
            <item>\'To cowards is no fort\'s defence\'; e\'en so
The self-oblivious men no blessing know.</item>
            <item>To him who nought foresees, recks not of anything,
The after woe shall sure repentance bring.</item>
            <item>Towards all unswerving, ever watchfulness of soul retain,
Where this is found there is no greater gain.</item>
            <item>Though things are arduous deemed, there\'s nought may not be won,
When work with mind\'s unslumbering energy and thought is done.</item>
            <item>Let things that merit praise thy watchful soul employ;
Who these despise attain through sevenfold births no joy.</item>
            <item>Think on the men whom scornful mind hath brought to nought,
When exultation overwhelms thy wildered thought.</item>
            <item>\'Tis easy what thou hast in mind to gain,
If what thou hast in mind thy mind retain.</item>
            <item>Search out, to no one favour show; with heart that justice loves
Consult, then act; this is the rule that right approves.</item>
            <item>All earth looks up to heav\'n whence raindrops fall;
All subjects look to king that ruleth all.</item>
            <item>Learning and virtue of the sages spring,
From all-controlling sceptre of the king.</item>
            <item>Whose heart embraces subjects all, lord over mighty land
Who rules, the world his feet embracing stands.</item>
            <item>Where king, who righteous laws regards, the sceptre wields,
There fall the showers, there rich abundance crowns the fields.</item>
            <item>Not lance gives kings the victory,
But sceptre swayed with equity.</item>
            <item>The king all the whole realm of earth protects;
And justice guards the king who right respects.</item>
            <item>Hard of access, nought searching out, with partial hand
The king who rules, shall sink and perish from the land.</item>
            <item>Abroad to guard, at home to punish, brings
No just reproach; \'tis work assigned to kings.</item>
            <item>By punishment of death the cruel to restrain,
Is as when farmer frees from weeds the tender grain</item>
            <item>Than one who plies the murderer\'s trade, more cruel is the king
Who all injustice works, his subjects harassing.</item>
            <item>As \'Give\' the robber cries with lance uplift,
So kings with sceptred hand implore a gift.</item>
            <item>Who makes no daily search for wrongs, nor justly rules, that king
Doth day by day his realm to ruin bring.</item>
            <item>Whose rod from right deflects, who counsel doth refuse,
At once his wealth and people utterly shall lose.</item>
            <item>His people\'s tears of sorrow past endurance, are not they
Sharp instruments to wear the monarch\'s wealth away?.</item>
            <item>To rulers\' rule stability is sceptre right;
When this is not, quenched is the rulers\' light.</item>
            <item>As lack of rain to thirsty lands beneath,
Is lack of grace in kings to all that breathe.</item>
            <item>To poverty it adds a sharper sting,
To live beneath the sway of unjust king.</item>
            <item>Where king from right deflecting, makes unrighteous gain,
The seasons change, the clouds pour down no rain.</item>
            <item>Where guardian guardeth not, udder of kine grows dry,
And Brahmans\' sacred lore will all forgotten lie.</item>
            <item>Who punishes, investigation made in due degree,
So as to stay advance of crime, a king is he.</item>
            <item>For length of days with still increasing joys on Heav\'n who call,
Should raise the rod with brow severe, but let it gently fall.</item>
            <item>Where subjects dread of cruel wrongs endure,
Ruin to unjust king is swift and sure.</item>
            <item>\'Ah! cruel is our king\', where subjects sadly say,
His age shall dwindle, swift his joy of life decay.</item>
            <item>Whom subjects scarce may see, of harsh forbidding countenance;
His ample wealth shall waste, blasted by demon\'s glance.</item>
            <item>The tyrant, harsh in speach and hard of eye,
His ample joy, swift fading, soon shall die.</item>
            <item>Harsh words and punishments severe beyond the right,
Are file that wears away the monarch\'s conquering might.</item>
            <item>Who leaves the work to those around, and thinks of it no more;
If he in wrathful mood reprove, his prosperous days are o\'er!.</item>
            <item>Who builds no fort whence he may foe defy,
In time of war shall fear and swiftly die.</item>
            <item>Tyrants with fools their counsels share:
Earth can no heavier burthen bear!.</item>
            <item>Since true benignity, that grace exceeding great, resides
In kingly souls, world in happy state abides.</item>
            <item>The world goes on its wonted way, since grace benign is there;
All other men are burthen for the earth to bear.</item>
            <item>Where not accordant with the song, what use of sounding chords?
What gain of eye that no benignant light affords?.</item>
            <item>The seeming eye of face gives no expressive light,
When not with duly meted kindness bright.</item>
            <item>Benignity is eyes\' adorning grace;
Without it eyes are wounds disfiguring face.</item>
            <item>Whose eyes \'neath brow infixed diffuse no ray
Of grace; like tree in earth infixed are they.</item>
            <item>Eyeless are they whose eyes with no benignant lustre shine;
Who\'ve eyes can never lack the light of grace benign.</item>
            <item>Who can benignant smile, yet leave no work undone;
By them as very own may all the earth be won.</item>
            <item>To smile on those that vex, with kindly face,
Enduring long, is most excelling grace.</item>
            <item>They drink with smiling grace, though poison interfused they see,
Who seek the praise of all-esteemed courtesy.</item>
            <item>These two: the code renowned and spies,
In these let king confide as eyes.</item>
            <item>Each day, of every subject every deed,
\'Tis duty of the king to learn with speed.</item>
            <item>By spies who spies, not weighing things they bring,
Nothing can victory give to that unwary king.</item>
            <item>His officers, his friends, his enemies,
All these who watch are trusty spies.</item>
            <item>Of unsuspected mien and all-unfearing eyes,
Who let no secret out, are trusty spies.</item>
            <item>As monk or devotee, through every hindrance making way,
A spy, whate\'er men do, must watchful mind display.</item>
            <item>A spy must search each hidden matter out,
And full report must render, free from doubt.</item>
            <item>Spying by spies, the things they tell
To test by other spies is well.</item>
            <item>One spy must not another see: contrive it so;
And things by three confirmed as truth you know.</item>
            <item>Reward not trusty spy in others\' sight,
Or all the mystery will come to light.</item>
            <item>\'Tis energy gives men o\'er that they own a true control;
They nothing own who own not energy of soul.</item>
            <item>The wealth of mind man owns a real worth imparts,
Material wealth man owns endures not, utterly departs.</item>
            <item>\'Lost is our wealth,\' they utter not this cry distressed,
The men of firm concentred energy of soul possessed.</item>
            <item>The man of energy of soul inflexible,
Good fortune seeks him out and comes a friend to dwell.</item>
            <item>With rising flood the rising lotus flower its stem unwinds;
The dignity of men is measured by their minds.</item>
            <item>Whate\'er you ponder, let your aim be loftly still,
Fate cannot hinder always, thwart you as it will.</item>
            <item>The men of lofty mind quail not in ruin\'s fateful hour,
The elephant retains his dignity mind arrows\' deadly shower.</item>
            <item>The soulless man can never gain
Th\' ennobling sense of power with men.</item>
            <item>Huge bulk of elephant with pointed tusk all armed,
When tiger threatens shrinks away alarmed!.</item>
            <item>Firmness of soul in man is real excellance;
Others are trees, their human form a mere pretence.</item>
            <item>Of household dignity the lustre beaming bright,
Flickers and dies when sluggish foulness dims its light.</item>
            <item>Let indolence, the death of effort, die,
If you\'d uphold your household\'s dignity.</item>
            <item>Who fosters indolence within his breast, the silly elf!
The house from which he springs shall perish ere himself.</item>
            <item>His family decays, and faults unheeded thrive,
Who, sunk in sloth, for noble objects doth not strive.</item>
            <item>Delay, oblivion, sloth, and sleep: these four
Are pleasure-boat to bear the doomed to ruin\'s shore.</item>
            <item>Though lords of earth unearned possessions gain,
The slothful ones no yield of good obtain.</item>
            <item>Who hug their sloth, nor noble works attempt,
Shall bear reproofs and words of just contempt.</item>
            <item>If sloth a dwelling find mid noble family,
Bondsmen to them that hate them shall they be.</item>
            <item>Who changes slothful habits saves
Himself from all that household rule depraves.</item>
            <item>The king whose life from sluggishness is rid,
Shall rule o\'er all by foot of mighty god bestrid.</item>
            <item>Say not, \'Tis hard\', in weak, desponding hour,
For strenuous effort gives prevailing power.</item>
            <item>In action be thou, \'ware of act\'s defeat;
The world leaves those who work leave incomplete!.</item>
            <item>In strenuous effort doth reside
The power of helping others: noble pride!.</item>
            <item>Beneficent intent in men by whom no strenuous work is wrought,
Like battle-axe in sexless being\'s hand availeth nought.</item>
            <item>Whose heart delighteth not in pleasure, but in action finds delight,
He wipes away his kinsmen\'s grief and stands the pillar of their might.</item>
            <item>Effort brings fortune\'s sure increase,
Its absence brings to nothingness.</item>
            <item>In sluggishness is seen misfortune\'s lurid form, the wise declare;
Where man unslothful toils, she of the lotus flower is there!.</item>
            <item>\'Tis no reproach unpropitious fate should ban;
But not to do man\'s work is foul disgrace to man!.</item>
            <item>Though fate-divine should make your labour vain;
Effort its labour\'s sure reward will gain.</item>
            <item>Who strive with undismayed, unfaltering mind,
At length shall leave opposing fate behind.</item>
            <item>Smile, with patient, hopeful heart, in troublous hour;
Meet and so vanquish grief; nothing hath equal power.</item>
            <item>Though sorrow, like a flood, comes rolling on,
When wise men\'s mind regards it,- it is gone.</item>
            <item>Who griefs confront with meek, ungrieving heart,
From them griefs, put to grief, depart.</item>
            <item>Like bullock struggle on through each obstructed way;
From such an one will troubles, troubled, roll away.</item>
            <item>When griefs press on, but fail to crush the patient heart,
Then griefs defeated, put to grief, depart.</item>
            <item>Who boasted not of wealth, nor gave it all their heart,
Will not bemoan the loss, when prosperous days depart.</item>
            <item>\'Man\'s frame is sorrow\'s target\', the noble mind reflects,
Nor meets with troubled mind the sorrows it expects.</item>
            <item>He seeks not joy, to sorrow man is born, he knows;
Such man will walk unharmed by touch of human woes.</item>
            <item>Mid joys he yields not heart to joys\' control.
Mid sorrows, sorrow cannot touch his soul.</item>
            <item>Who pain as pleasure takes, he shall acquire
The bliss to which his foes in vain aspire.</item>
            <item>A minister is he who grasps, with wisdom large,
Means, time, work\'s mode, and functions rare he must discharge.</item>
            <item>A minister must greatness own of guardian power, determined mind,
Learn\'d wisdom, manly effort with the former five combined.</item>
            <item>A minister is he whose power can foes divide,
Attach more firmly friends, of severed ones can heal the breaches wide.</item>
            <item>A minister has power to see the methods help afford,
To ponder long, then utter calm conclusive word.</item>
            <item>The man who virtue knows, has use of wise and pleasant words.
With plans for every season apt, in counsel aid affords.</item>
            <item>When native subtilty combines with sound scholastic lore,
\'Tis subtilty surpassing all, which nothing stands before.</item>
            <item>Though knowing all that books can teach, \'tis truest tact
To follow common sense of men in act.</item>
            <item>\'Tis duty of the man in place aloud to say
The very truth, though unwise king may cast his words away.</item>
            <item>A minister who by king\'s side plots evil things
Worse woes than countless foemen brings.</item>
            <item>For gain of end desired just counsel nought avails
To minister, when tact in execution fails.</item>
            <item>A tongue that rightly speaks the right is greatest gain,
It stands alone midst goodly things that men obtain.</item>
            <item>Since gain and loss in life on speech depend,
From careless slip in speech thyself defend.</item>
            <item>\'Tis speech that spell-bound holds the listening ear,
While those who have not heard desire to hear.</item>
            <item>Speak words adapted well to various hearers\' state;
No higher virtue lives, no gain more surely great.</item>
            <item>Speak out your speech, when once \'tis past dispute
That none can utter speech that shall your speech refute.</item>
            <item>Charming each hearer\'s ear, of others\' words to seize the sense,
Is method wise of men of spotless excellence.</item>
            <item>Mighty in word, of unforgetful mind, of fearless speech,
\'Tis hard for hostile power such man to overreach.</item>
            <item>Swiftly the listening world will gather round,
When men of mighty speech the weighty theme propound.</item>
            <item>Who have not skill ten faultless words to utter plain,
Their tongues will itch with thousand words man\'s ears to pain.</item>
            <item>Like scentless flower in blooming garland bound
Are men who can\'t their lore acquired to other\'s ears expound.</item>
            <item>The good external help confers is worldly gain;
By action good men every needed gift obtain.</item>
            <item>From action evermore thyself restrain
Of glory and of good that yields no gain.</item>
            <item>Who tell themselves that nobler things shall yet be won
All deeds that dim the light of glory must they shun.</item>
            <item>Though troubles press, no shameful deed they do,
Whose eyes the ever-during vision view.</item>
            <item>Do nought that soul repenting must deplore,
If thou hast sinned, \'tis well if thou dost sin no more.</item>
            <item>Though her that bore thee hung\'ring thou behold, no deed
Do thou, that men of perfect soul have crime decreed.</item>
            <item>Than store of wealth guilt-laden souls obtain,
The sorest poverty of perfect soul is richer gain.</item>
            <item>To those who hate reproof and do forbidden thing.
What prospers now, in after days shall anguish bring.</item>
            <item>What\'s gained through tears with tears shall go;
From loss good deeds entail harvests of blessings grow.</item>
            <item>In pot of clay unburnt he water pours and would retain,
Who seeks by wrong the realm in wealth and safety to maintain.</item>
            <item>What men call \'power in action\' know for \'power of mind\'
Externe to man all other aids you find.</item>
            <item>\'Each hindrance shun\', \'unyielding onward press, If obstacle be there,\'
These two define your way, so those that search out truth declare.</item>
            <item>Man\'s fitting work is known but by success achieved;
In midst the plan revealed brings ruin ne\'er to be retrieved.</item>
            <item>Easy to every man the speech that shows the way;
Hard thing to shape one\'s life by words they say!.</item>
            <item>The power in act of men renowned and great,
With king acceptance finds and fame through all the state.</item>
            <item>Whate\'er men think, ev\'n as they think, may men obtain,
If those who think can steadfastness of will retain.</item>
            <item>Despise not men of modest bearing; Look not at form, but what men are:
For some there live, high functions sharing, Like linch-pin of the mighty car!.</item>
            <item>What clearly eye discerns as right, with steadfast will,
And mind unslumbering, that should man fulfil.</item>
            <item>Though toil and trouble face thee, firm resolve hold fast,
And do the deeds that pleasure yield at last.</item>
            <item>The world desires not men of every power possessed,
Who power in act desire not,- crown of all the rest.</item>
            <item>The Resolve is counsel\'s end, If resolutions halt
In weak delays, still unfulfilled, \'tis grievous fault.</item>
            <item>Slumber when sleepy work\'s in hand: beware
Thou slumber not when action calls for sleepless care!.</item>
            <item>When way is clear, prompt let your action be;
When not, watch till some open path you see.</item>
            <item>With work or foe, when you neglect some little thing,
If you reflect, like smouldering fire, \'twill ruin bring.</item>
            <item>Treasure and instrument and time and deed and place of act:
These five, till every doubt remove, think o\'er with care exact.</item>
            <item>Accomplishment, the hindrances, large profits won
By effort: these compare,- then let the work be done.</item>
            <item>Who would succeed must thus begin: first let him ask
The thoughts of them who thoroughly know the task.</item>
            <item>By one thing done you reach a second work\'s accomplishment;
So furious elephant to snare its fellow brute is sent.</item>
            <item>Than kindly acts to friends more urgent thing to do,
Is making foes to cling as friends attached to you.</item>
            <item>The men of lesser realm, fearing the people\'s inward dread,
Accepting granted terms, to mightier ruler bow the head.</item>
            <item>Benevolence high birth, the courtesy kings love:-
These qualities the envoy of a king approve.</item>
            <item>Love, knowledge, power of chosen words, three things,
Should he possess who speaks the words of kings.</item>
            <item>Mighty in lore amongst the learned must he be,
Midst jav\'lin-bearing kings who speaks the words of victory.</item>
            <item>Sense, goodly grace, and knowledge exquisite.
Who hath these three for envoy\'s task is fit.</item>
            <item>In terms concise, avoiding wrathful speech, who utters pleasant word,
An envoy he who gains advantage for his lord.</item>
            <item>An envoy meet is he, well-learned, of fearless eye
Who speaks right home, prepared for each emergency.</item>
            <item>He is the best who knows what\'s due, the time considered well,
The place selects, then ponders long ere he his errand tell.</item>
            <item>Integrity, resources, soul determined, truthfulness.
Who rightly speaks his message must these marks possess.</item>
            <item>His faltering lips must utter no unworthy thing,
Who stands, with steady eye, to speak the mandates of his king.</item>
            <item>Death to the faithful one his embassy may bring;
To envoy gains assured advantage for his king.</item>
            <item>Who warm them at the fire draw not too near, nor keep too much aloof;
Thus let them act who dwell beneath of warlike kings the palace-roof.</item>
            <item>To those who prize not state that kings are wont to prize,
The king himself abundant wealth supplies.</item>
            <item>Who would walk warily, let him of greater faults beware;
To clear suspicions once aroused is an achievement rare.</item>
            <item>All whispered words and interchange of smiles repress,
In presence of the men who kingly power possess.</item>
            <item>Seek not, ask not, the secret of the king to hear;
But if he lets the matter forth, give ear!.</item>
            <item>Knowing the signs, waiting for fitting time, with courteous care,
Things not displeasing, needful things, declare.</item>
            <item>Speak pleasant things, but never utter idle word;
Not though by monarch\'s ears with pleasure heard.</item>
            <item>Say not, \'He\'s young, my kinsman,\' despising thus your king;
But reverence the glory kingly state doth bring.</item>
            <item>\'We\'ve gained his grace, boots nought what graceless acts we do\',
So deem not sages who the changeless vision view.</item>
            <item>Who think \'We\'re ancient friends\' and do unseemly things;
To these familiarity sure ruin brings.</item>
            <item>Who knows the sign, and reads unuttered thought, the gem is he,
Of earth round traversed by the changeless sea.</item>
            <item>Undoubting, who the minds of men can scan,
As deity regard that gifted man.</item>
            <item>Who by the sign the signs interprets plain,
Give any member up his aid to gain.</item>
            <item>Who reads what\'s shown by signs, though words unspoken be,
In form may seem as other men, in function nobler far is he.</item>
            <item>By sign who knows not sings to comprehend, what gain,
\'Mid all his members, from his eyes does he obtain?.</item>
            <item>As forms around in crystal mirrored clear we find,
The face will show what\'s throbbing in the mind.</item>
            <item>Than speaking countenance hath aught more prescient skill?
Rejoice or burn with rage, \'tis the first herald still!.</item>
            <item>To see the face is quite enough, in presence brought,
When men can look within and know the lurking thought.</item>
            <item>The eye speaks out the hate or friendly soul of man;
To those who know the eye\'s swift varying moods to scan.</item>
            <item>The men of keen discerning soul no other test apply
(When you their secret ask) than man\'s revealing eye.</item>
            <item>Men pure in heart, who know of words the varied force,
Should to their audience known adapt their well-arranged discourse.</item>
            <item>Good men to whom the arts of eloquence are known,
Should seek occasion meet, and say what well they\'ve made their own.</item>
            <item>Unversed in councils, who essays to speak.
Knows not the way of suasive words,- and all is weak.</item>
            <item>Before the bright ones shine as doth the light!
Before the dull ones be as purest stucco white!.</item>
            <item>Midst all good things the best is modest grace,
That speaks not first before the elders\' face.</item>
            <item>As in the way one tottering falls, is slip before
The men whose minds are filled with varied lore.</item>
            <item>The learning of the learned sage shines bright
To those whose faultless skill can value it aright.</item>
            <item>To speak where understanding hearers you obtain,
Is sprinkling water on the fields of growing grain!.</item>
            <item>In councils of the good, who speak good things with penetrating power,
In councils of the mean, let them say nought, e\'en in oblivious hour.</item>
            <item>Ambrosia in the sewer spilt, is word
Spoken in presence of the alien herd.</item>
            <item>Men, pure in heart, who know of words the varied force,
The mighty council\'s moods discern, nor fail in their discourse.</item>
            <item>Who what they\'ve learned, in penetrating words heve learned to say,
Before the learn\'d among the learn\'d most learn\'d are they.</item>
            <item>Many encountering death in face of foe will hold their ground;
Who speak undaunted in the council hall are rarely found.</item>
            <item>What you have learned, in penetrating words speak out before
The learn\'d; but learn what men more learn\'d can teach you more.</item>
            <item>By rule, to dialectic art your mind apply,
That in the council fearless you may make an apt reply.</item>
            <item>To those who lack the hero\'s eye what can the sword avail?
Or science what, to those before the council keen who quail?.</item>
            <item>As shining sword before the foe which \'sexless being\' bears,
Is science learned by him the council\'s face who fears.</item>
            <item>Though many things they\'ve learned, yet useless are they all,
To man who cannot well and strongly speak in council hall.</item>
            <item>Who, though they\'ve learned, before the council of the good men quake,
Than men unlearn\'d a lower place must take.</item>
            <item>Who what they\'ve learned, in penetrating words know not to say,
The council fearing, though they live, as dead are they.</item>
            <item>Where spreads fertility unfailing, where resides a band,
Of virtuous men, and those of ample wealth, call that a \'land\' .</item>
            <item>That is a \'land\' which men desire for wealth\'s abundant share,
Yielding rich increase, where calamities are rare.</item>
            <item>When burthens press, it bears; Yet, With unfailing hand
To king due tribute pays: that is the \'land\' .</item>
            <item>That is a \'land\' whose peaceful annals know,
Nor famine fierce, nor wasting plague, nor ravage of the foe.</item>
            <item>From factions free, and desolating civil strife, and band
Of lurking murderers that king afflict, that is the \'land\'.</item>
            <item>Chief of all lands is that, where nought disturbs its peace;
Or, if invaders come, still yields its rich increase.</item>
            <item>Waters from rains and springs, a mountain near, and waters thence;
These make a land, with fortress\' sure defence.</item>
            <item>A country\'s jewels are these five: unfailing health,
Fertility, and joy, a sure defence, and wealth.</item>
            <item>That is a land that yields increase unsought,
That is no land whose gifts with toil are bought.</item>
            <item>Though blest with all these varied gifts\' increase,
A land gains nought that is not with its king at peace.</item>
            <item>fort is wealth to those who act against their foes;
Is wealth to them who, fearing, guard themselves from woes.</item>
            <item>A fort is that which owns fount of waters crystal clear,
An open space, a hill, and shade of beauteous forest near.</item>
            <item>Height, breadth, strength, difficult access:
Science declares a fort must these possess.</item>
            <item>A fort must need but slight defence, yet ample be,
Defying all the foeman\'s energy.</item>
            <item>Impregnable, containing ample stores of food,
A fort for those within, must be a warlike station good.</item>
            <item>A fort, with all munitions amply stored,
In time of need should good reserves afford.</item>
            <item>A fort should be impregnable to foes who gird it round,
Or aim there darts from far, or mine beneath the ground.</item>
            <item>Howe\'er the circling foe may strive access to win,
A fort should give the victory to those who guard within.</item>
            <item>At outset of the strife a fort should foes dismay;
And greatness gain by deeds in every glorious day.</item>
            <item>Howe\'er majestic castled walls may rise,
To craven souls no fortress strength supplies.</item>
            <item>Nothing exists save wealth, that can
Change man of nought to worthy man.</item>
            <item>Those who have nought all will despise;
All raise the wealthy to the skies.</item>
            <item>Wealth, the lamp unfailing, speeds to every land,
Dispersing darkness at its lord\'s command.</item>
            <item>Their wealth, who blameless means can use aright,
Is source of virtue and of choice delight.</item>
            <item>Wealth gained by loss of love and grace,
Let man cast off from his embrace.</item>
            <item>Wealth that falls to him as heir, wealth from the kingdom\'s dues,
The spoils of slaughtered foes; these are the royal revenues.</item>
            <item>\'Tis love that kindliness as offspring bears:
And wealth as bounteous nurse the infant rears.</item>
            <item>As one to view the strife of elephants who takes his stand,
On hill he\'s climbed, is he who works with money in his hand.</item>
            <item>Make money! Foeman\'s insolence o\'ergrown
To lop away no keener steel is known.</item>
            <item>Who plenteous store of glorious wealth have gained,
By them the other two are easily obtained.</item>
            <item>A conquering host, complete in all its limbs, that fears no wound,
Mid treasures of the king is chiefest found.</item>
            <item>In adverse hour, to face undaunted might of conquering foe,
Is bravery that only veteran host can show.</item>
            <item>Though, like the sea, the angry mice send forth their battle cry;
What then? The dragon breathes upon them, and they die!.</item>
            <item>That is a host, by no defeats, by no desertions shamed,
For old hereditary courage famed.</item>
            <item>That is a \'host\' that joins its ranks, and mightily withstands,
Though death with sudden wrath should fall upon its bands.</item>
            <item>Valour with honour, sure advance in glory\'s path, with confidence;
To warlike host these four are sure defence.</item>
            <item>A valiant army bears the onslaught, onward goes,
Well taught with marshalled ranks to meet their coming foes.</item>
            <item>Though not in war offensive or defensive skilled;
An army gains applause when well equipped and drilled.</item>
            <item>Where weakness, clinging fear and poverty
Are not, the host will gain the victory.</item>
            <item>Though men abound, all ready for the war,
No army is where no fit leaders are.</item>
            <item>Ye foes! stand not before my lord! for many a one
Who did my lord withstand, now stands in stone!.</item>
            <item>Who aims at elephant, though dart should fail, has greater praise.
Than he who woodland hare with winged arrow slays.</item>
            <item>Fierceness in hour of strife heroic greatness shows;
Its edge is kindness to our suffering foes.</item>
            <item>At elephant he hurls the dart in hand; for weapon pressed,
He laughs and plucks the javelin from his wounded breast.</item>
            <item>To hero fearless must it not defeat appear,
If he but wink his eye when foemen hurls his spear.</item>
            <item>The heroes, counting up their days, set down as vain
Each day when they no glorious wound sustain.</item>
            <item>Who seek for world-wide fame, regardless of their life,
The glorious clasp adorns, sign of heroic strife.</item>
            <item>Fearless they rush where\'er \'the tide of battle rolls\';
The king\'s reproof damps not the ardour of their eager souls.</item>
            <item>Who says they err, and visits them scorn,
Who die and faithful guard the vow they\'ve sworn?.</item>
            <item>If monarch\'s eyes o\'erflow with tears for hero slain,
Who would not beg such boon of glorious death to gain?.</item>
            <item>What so hard for men to gain as friendship true?
What so sure defence \'gainst all that foe can do?.</item>
            <item>Friendship with men fulfilled of good Waxes like the crescent moon;
Friendship with men of foolish mood, Like the full orb, waneth soon.</item>
            <item>Learned scroll the more you ponder, Sweeter grows the mental food;
So the heart by use grows fonder, Bound in friendship with the good.</item>
            <item>Nor for laughter only friendship all the pleasant day,
But for strokes of sharp reproving, when from right you stray.</item>
            <item>Not association constant, not affection\'s token bind;
\'Tis the unison of feeling friends unites of kindred mind.</item>
            <item>Not the face\'s smile of welcome shows the friend sincere,
But the heart\'s rejoicing gladness when the friend is near.</item>
            <item>Friendship from ruin saves, in way of virtue keeps;
In troublous time, it weeps with him who weeps.</item>
            <item>As hand of him whose vesture slips away,
Friendship at once the coming grief will stay.</item>
            <item>And where is friendship\'s royal seat? In stable mind,
Where friend in every time of need support may find.</item>
            <item>Mean is the friendship that men blazon forth,
\'He\'s thus to me\' and \'such to him my worth\'.</item>
            <item>To make an untried man your friend is ruin sure;
For friendship formed unbroken must endure.</item>
            <item>Alliance with the man you have not proved and proved again,
In length of days will give you mortal pain.</item>
            <item>Temper, descent, defects, associations free
From blame: know these, then let the man be friend to thee.</item>
            <item>Who, born of noble race, from guilt would shrink with shame,
Pay any price so you as friend that man may claim.</item>
            <item>Make them your chosen friend whose words repentance move,
With power prescription\'s path to show, while evil they reprove.</item>
            <item>Ruin itself one blessing lends:
\'Tis staff that measures out one\'s friends.</item>
            <item>\'Tis gain to any man, the sages say,
Friendship of fools to put away.</item>
            <item>Think not the thoughts that dwarf the soul; nor take
For friends the men who friends in time of grief forsake.</item>
            <item>Of friends deserting us on ruin\'s brink,
\'Tis torture e\'en in life\'s last hour to think.</item>
            <item>Cling to the friendship of the spotless one\'s; whate\'er you pay.
Renounce alliance with the men of evil way.</item>
            <item>Familiarity is friendship\'s silent pact,
That puts restraint on no familiar act</item>
            <item>Familiar freedom friendship\'s very frame supplies;
To be its savour sweet is duty of the wise.</item>
            <item>When to familiar acts men kind response refuse,
What fruit from ancient friendship\'s use?.</item>
            <item>When friends unbidden do familiar acts with loving heart,
Friends take the kindly deed in friendly part.</item>
            <item>Not folly merely, but familiar carelessness,
Esteem it, when your friends cause you distress.</item>
            <item>Who stand within the bounds quit not, though loss impends,
Association with the old familiar friends.</item>
            <item>Waters True friends, well versed in loving ways,
Cease not to love, when friend their love betrays.</item>
            <item>In strength of friendship rare of friend\'s disgrace who will not hear,
The day his friend offends will day of grace to him appear.</item>
            <item>Friendship of old and faithful friends,
Who ne\'er forsake, the world commends.</item>
            <item>Ill-wishers even wish them well, who guard.
For ancient friends, their wonted kind regard.</item>
            <item>Though evil men should all-absorbing friendship show,
Their love had better die away than grow.</item>
            <item>What though you gain or lose friendship of men of alien heart,
Who when you thrive are friends, and when you fail depart?.</item>
            <item>These are alike: the friends who ponder friendship\'s gain
Those who accept whate\'er you give, and all the plundering train.</item>
            <item>A steed untrained will leave you in the tug of war;
Than friends like that to dwell alone is better far.</item>
            <item>\'Tis better not to gain than gain the friendship profitless
Of men of little minds, who succour fails when dangers press.</item>
            <item>Better ten million times incur the wise man\'s hate,
Than form with foolish men a friendship intimate.</item>
            <item>From foes ten million fold a greater good you gain,
Than friendship yields that\'s formed with laughers vain.</item>
            <item>Those men who make a grievous toil of what they do
On your behalf, their friendship silently eschew.</item>
            <item>E\'en in a dream the intercourse is bitterness
With men whose deeds are other than their words profess.</item>
            <item>In anywise maintain not intercourse with those,
Who in the house are friends, in hall are slandering foes.</item>
            <item>Anvil where thou shalt smitten be, when men occasion find,
Is friendship\'s form without consenting mind.</item>
            <item>Friendship of those who seem our kin, but are not really kind.
Will change from hour to hour like woman\'s mind.</item>
            <item>To heartfelt goodness men ignoble hardly may attain,
Although abundant stores of goodly lore they gain.</item>
            <item>\'Tis fitting you should dread dissemblers\' guile,
Whose hearts are bitter while their faces smile.</item>
            <item>When minds are not in unison, \'its never; just,
In any words men speak to put your trust.</item>
            <item>Though many goodly words they speak in friendly tone,
The words of foes will speedily be known.</item>
            <item>To pliant speech from hostile lips give thou no ear;
\'Tis pliant bow that show the deadly peril near! .</item>
            <item>In hands that worship weapon ten hidden lies;
Such are the tears that fall from foeman\'s eyes.</item>
            <item>\'Tis just, when men make much of you, and then despise,
To make them smile, and slap in friendship\'s guise.</item>
            <item>When time shall come that foes as friends appear,
Then thou, to hide a hostile heart, a smiling face may\'st wear.</item>
            <item>Familiarity What one thing merits folly\'s special name.
Letting gain go, loss for one\'s own to claim!.</item>
            <item>\'Mid follies chiefest folly is to fix your love
On deeds which to your station unbefitting prove.</item>
            <item>Ashamed of nothing, searching nothing out, of loveless heart,
Nought cherishing, \'tis thus the fool will play his part.</item>
            <item>The sacred law he reads and learns, to other men expounds,-
Himself obeys not; where can greater fool be found? .</item>
            <item>The fool will merit hell in one brief life on earth,
In which he entering sinks through sevenfold round of birth.</item>
            <item>When fool some task attempts with uninstructed pains,
It fails; nor that alone, himself he binds with chains.</item>
            <item>When fools are blessed with fortune\'s bounteous store,
Their foes feed full, their friends are prey to hunger sore.</item>
            <item>When folly\'s hand grasps wealth\'s increase, \'twill be
As when a mad man raves in drunken glee.</item>
            <item>Friendship of fools is very pleasant thing,
Parting with them will leave behind no sting.</item>
            <item>Like him who seeks his couch with unwashed feet,
Is fool whose foot intrudes where wise men meet.</item>
            <item>Want of knowledge, \'mid all wants the sorest want we deem;
Want of other things the world will not as want esteem.</item>
            <item>The gift of foolish man, with willing heart bestowed, is nought,
But blessing by receiver\'s penance bought.</item>
            <item>With keener anguish foolish men their own hearts wring,
Than aught that even malice of their foes can bring.</item>
            <item>What is stupidity? The arrogance that cries,
\'Behold, we claim the glory of the wise.\'</item>
            <item>If men what they have never learned assume to know,
Upon their real learning\'s power a doubt \'twill throw.</item>
            <item>Fools are they who their nakedness conceal,
And yet their faults unveiled reveal.</item>
            <item>From out his soul who lets the mystic teachings die,
Entails upon himself abiding misery.</item>
            <item>Advised, he heeds not; of himself knows nothing wise;
This man\'s whole life is all one plague until he dies.</item>
            <item>That man is blind to eyes that will not see who knowledge shows;-
The blind man still in his blind fashion knows.</item>
            <item>Who what the world affirms as false proclaim,
O\'er all the earth receive a demon\'s name.</item>
            <item>Hostility disunion\'s plague will bring,
That evil quality, to every living thing.</item>
            <item>Though men disunion plan, and do thee much despite
\'Tis best no enmity to plan, nor evil deeds requite.</item>
            <item>If enmity, that grievous plague, you shun,
Endless undying praises shall be won.</item>
            <item>Joy of joys abundant grows,
When malice dies that woe of woes.</item>
            <item>If men from enmity can keep their spirits free,
Who over them shall gain the victory?.</item>
            <item>The life of those who cherished enmity hold dear,
To grievous fault and utter death is near.</item>
            <item>The very truth that greatness gives their eyes can never see,
Who only know to work men woe, fulfilled of enmity.</item>
            <item>\'Tis gain to turn the soul from enmity;
Ruin reigns where this hath mastery.</item>
            <item>Men think not hostile thought in fortune\'s favouring hour,
They cherish enmity when in misfortune\'s power.</item>
            <item>From enmity do all afflictive evils flow;
But friendliness doth wealth of kindly good bestow.</item>
            <item>With stronger than thyself, turn from the strife away;
With weaker shun not, rather court the fray.</item>
            <item>No kinsman\'s love, no strength of friends has he;
How can he bear his foeman\'s enmity?.</item>
            <item>A craven thing! knows nought, accords with none, gives nought away;
To wrath of any foe he falls an easy prey.</item>
            <item>His wrath still blazes, every secret told; each day
This man\'s in every place to every foe an easy prey.</item>
            <item>No way of right he scans, no precepts bind, no crimes affright,
No grace of good he owns; such man\'s his foes\' delight.</item>
            <item>Blind in his rage, his lustful passions rage and swell;
If such a man mislikes you, like it well.</item>
            <item>Unseemly are his deeds, yet proffering aid, the man draws nigh:
His hate- \'tis cheap at any price- be sure to buy!.</item>
            <item>No gracious gifts he owns, faults many cloud his fame;
His foes rejoice, for none with kindred claim.</item>
            <item>The joy of victory is never far removed from those
Who\'ve luck to meet with ignorant and timid foes.</item>
            <item>The task of angry war with men unlearned in virtue\'s lore
Who will not meet, glory shall meet him never more.</item>
            <item>For Hate, that ill-conditioned thing not e\'en in jest.
Let any evil longing rule your breast.</item>
            <item>Although you hate incur of those whose ploughs are bows,
Make not the men whose ploughs are words your foes!.</item>
            <item>Than men of mind diseased, a wretch more utterly forlorn,
Is he who stands alone, object of many foeman\'s scorn.</item>
            <item>The world secure on his dexterity depends,
Whose worthy rule can change his foes to friends.</item>
            <item>Without ally, who fights with twofold enemy o\'ermatched,
Must render one of these a friend attached.</item>
            <item>Whether you trust or not, in time of sore distress,
Questions of diff\'rence or agreement cease to press.</item>
            <item>To those who know them not, complain not of your woes;
Nor to your foeman\'s eyes infirmities disclose.</item>
            <item>Know thou the way, then do thy part, thyself defend;
Thus shall the pride of those that hate thee have an end.</item>
            <item>Destroy the thorn, while tender point can work thee no offence;
Matured by time, \'twill pierce the hand that plucks it thence.</item>
            <item>But breathe upon them, and they surely die,
Who fail to tame the pride of angry enemy.</item>
            <item>Water and shade, if they unwholesome prove, will bring you pain.
And qualities of friends who treacherous act, will be your bane.</item>
            <item>Dread not the foes that as drawn swords appear;
Friendship of foes, who seem like kinsmen, fear!.</item>
            <item>Of hidden hate beware, and guard thy life;
In troublous time \'twill deeper wound than potter\'s knife.</item>
            <item>If secret enmities arise that minds pervert,
Then even kin unkind will work thee grievous hurt.</item>
            <item>Amid one\'s relatives if hidden hath arise,
\'Twill hurt inflict in deadly wise.</item>
            <item>If discord finds a place midst those who dwelt at one before,
\'Tis ever hard to keep destruction from the door.</item>
            <item>As casket with its cover, though in one they live alway,
No union to the house where hate concealed hath sway.</item>
            <item>As gold with which the file contends is worn away,
So strength of house declines where hate concealed hath sway.</item>
            <item>Though slight as shred of \'seasame\' seed it be,
Destruction lurks in hidden enmity.</item>
            <item>Domestic life with those who don\'t agree,
Is dwelling in a shed with snake for company.</item>
            <item>The chiefest care of those who guard themselves from ill,
Is not to slight the powers of those who work their mighty will.</item>
            <item>If men will lead their lives reckless of great men\'s will,
Such life, through great men\'s powers, will bring perpetual ill.</item>
            <item>Who ruin covet let them shut their ears, and do despite
To those who, where they list to ruin have the might.</item>
            <item>When powerless man \'gainst men of power will evil deeds essay,
Tis beck\'ning with the hand for Death to seize them for its prey.</item>
            <item>Who dare the fiery wrath of monarchs dread,
Where\'er they flee, are numbered with the dead.</item>
            <item>Though in the conflagration caught, he may escape from thence:
He \'scapes not who in life to great ones gives offence.</item>
            <item>Though every royal gift, and stores of wealth your life should crown,
What are they, if the worthy men of mighty virtue frown?.</item>
            <item>If they, whose virtues like a mountain rise, are light esteemed;
They die from earth who, with their households, ever-during seemed.</item>
            <item>When blazes forth the wrath of men of lofty fame,
Kings even fall from high estate and perish in the flame.</item>
            <item>Though all-surpassing wealth of aid the boast,
If men in glorious virtue great are wrath, they\'re lost.</item>
            <item>Who give their soul to love of wife acquire not nobler gain;
Who give their soul to strenuous deeds such meaner joys disdain.</item>
            <item>Who gives himself to love of wife, careless of noble name
His wealth will clothe him with o\'erwhelming shame.</item>
            <item>Who to his wife submits, his strange, unmanly mood
Will daily bring him shame among the good.</item>
            <item>No glory crowns e\'en manly actions wrought
By him who dreads his wife, nor gives the other world a thought.</item>
            <item>Who quakes before his wife will ever tremble too,
Good deeds to men of good deserts to do.</item>
            <item>Though, like the demi-gods, in bliss they dwell secure from harm,
Those have no dignity who fear the housewife\'s slender arm.</item>
            <item>The dignity of modest womanhood excels
His manliness, obedient to a woman\'s law who dwells.</item>
            <item>In Who to the will of her with beauteous brow their lives conform,
Aid not their friends in need, nor acts of charity perform.</item>
            <item>No virtuous deed, no seemly wealth, no pleasure, rests
With them who live obedient to their wives\' behests.</item>
            <item>Where pleasures of the mind, that dwell in realms of thought, abound,
Folly, that springs from overweening woman\'s love, is never found.</item>
            <item>Those that choice armlets wear who seek not thee with love,
But seek thy wealth, their pleasant words will ruin prove.</item>
            <item>Who weigh the gain, and utter virtuous words with vicious heart,
Weighing such women\'s worth, from their society depart.</item>
            <item>As one in darkened room, some stranger corpse inarms,
Is he who seeks delight in mercenary women\'s charms!.</item>
            <item>Their worthless charms, whose only weal is wealth of gain,
From touch of these the wise, who seek the wealth of grace, abstain.</item>
            <item>From contact with their worthless charms, whose charms to all are free,
The men with sense of good and lofty wisdom blest will flee.</item>
            <item>From touch of those who worthless charms, with wanton arts, display,
The men who would their own true good maintain will turn away.</item>
            <item>Who cherish alien thoughts while folding in their feigned embrace,
These none approach save those devoid of virtue\'s grace.</item>
            <item>As demoness who lures to ruin woman\'s treacherous love
To men devoid of wisdom\'s searching power will prove.</item>
            <item>The wanton\'s tender arm, with gleaming jewels decked,
Is hell, where sink degraded souls of men abject.</item>
            <item>Women of double minds, strong drink, and dice; to these giv\'n o\'er,
Are those on whom the light of Fortune shines no more.</item>
            <item>Who love the palm\'s intoxicating juice, each day,
No rev\'rence they command, their glory fades away.</item>
            <item>Drink not inebriating draught. Let him count well the cost.
Who drinks, by drinking, all good men\'s esteem is lost.</item>
            <item>The drunkard\'s joy is sorrow to his mother\'s eyes;
What must it be in presence of the truly wise?.</item>
            <item>Shame, goodly maid, will turn her back for aye on them
Who sin the drunkard\'s grievous sin, that all condemn.</item>
            <item>With gift of goods who self-oblivion buys,
Is ignorant of all that man should prize.</item>
            <item>Sleepers are as the dead, no otherwise they seem;
Who drink intoxicating draughts, they poison quaff, we deem.</item>
            <item>Who turn aside to drink, and droop their heavy eye,
Shall be their townsmen\'s jest, when they the fault espy.</item>
            <item>No more in secret drink, and then deny thy hidden fraud;
What in thy mind lies hid shall soon be known abroad.</item>
            <item>Like him who, lamp in hand, would seek one sunk beneath the wave.
Is he who strives to sober drunken man with reasonings grave.</item>
            <item>When one, in sober interval, a drunken man espies,
Does he not think, \'Such is my folly in my revelries\'?.</item>
            <item>Seek not the gamester\'s play; though you should win,
Your gain is as the baited hook the fish takes in.</item>
            <item>Is there for gamblers, too, that gaining one a hundred lose, some way
That they may good obtain, and see a prosperous day?.</item>
            <item>If prince unceasing speak of nought but play,
Treasure and revenue will pass from him away.</item>
            <item>Gaming brings many woes, and ruins fair renown;
Nothing to want brings men so surely down.</item>
            <item>The dice, and gaming-hall, and gamester\'s art, they eager sought,
Thirsting for gain- the men in other days who came to nought.</item>
            <item>Gambling\'s Misfortune\'s other name: o\'er whom she casts her veil,
They suffer grievous want, and sorrows sore bewail.</item>
            <item>Ancestral wealth and noble fame to ruin haste,
If men in gambler\'s halls their precious moments waste.</item>
            <item>Gambling wastes wealth, to falsehood bends the soul: it drives away
All grace, and leaves the man to utter misery a prey.</item>
            <item>Clothes, wealth, food, praise, and learning, all depart
From him on gambler\'s gain who sets his heart.</item>
            <item>Howe\'er he lose, the gambler\'s heart is ever in the play;
E\'en so the soul, despite its griefs, would live on earth alway.</item>
            <item>The learned books count three, with wind as first; of these,
As any one prevail, or fail; \'twill cause disease.</item>
            <item>No need of medicine to heal your body\'s pain,
If, what you ate before digested well, you eat again.</item>
            <item>Who has a body gained may long the gift retain,
If, food digested well, in measure due he eat again.</item>
            <item>Knowing the food digested well, when hunger prompteth thee,
With constant care, the viands choose that well agree.</item>
            <item>With self-denial take the well-selected meal;
So shall thy frame no sudden sickness feel.</item>
            <item>On modest temperance as pleasures pure,
So pain attends the greedy epicure.</item>
            <item>Who largely feeds, nor measure of the fire within maintains,
That thoughtless man shall feel unmeasured pains.</item>
            <item>Disease, its cause, what may abate the ill:
Let leech examine these, then use his skill.</item>
            <item>The habitudes of patient and disease, the crises of the ill
These must the learned leech think over well, then use his skill.</item>
            <item>For patient, leech, and remedies, and him who waits by patient\'s side,
The art of medicine must fourfold code of laws provide.</item>
            <item>Save in the scions of a noble house, you never find
Instinctive sense of right and virtuous shame combined.</item>
            <item>In these three things the men of noble birth fail not:
In virtuous deed and truthful word, and chastened thought.</item>
            <item>The smile, the gift, the pleasant word, unfailing courtesy
These are the signs, they say, of true nobility.</item>
            <item>Millions on millions piled would never win
The men of noble race to soul-degrading sin.</item>
            <item>Though stores for charity should fail within, the ancient race
Will never lose its old ancestral grace.</item>
            <item>Whose minds are set to live as fits their sire\'s unspotted fame,
Stooping to low deceit, commit no deeds that gender shame.</item>
            <item>The faults of men of noble race are seen by every eye,
As spots on her bright orb that walks sublime the evening sky.</item>
            <item>If lack of love appear in those who bear some goodly name,
\'Twill make men doubt the ancestry they claim.</item>
            <item>Of soil the plants that spring thereout will show the worth:
The words they speak declare the men of noble birth.</item>
            <item>Who seek for good the grace of virtuous shame must know;
Who seek for noble name to all must reverence show.</item>
            <item>Though linked to splendours man no otherwise may gain,
Reject each act that may thine honour\'s clearness stain.</item>
            <item>Who seek with glory to combine honour\'s untarnished fame,
Do no inglorious deeds, though men accord them glory\'s name.</item>
            <item>Bow down thy soul, with increase blest, in happy hour;
Lift up thy heart, when stript of all by fortune\'s power.</item>
            <item>Like hairs from off the head that fall to earth,
When fall\'n from high estate are men of noble birth.</item>
            <item>If meanness, slight as \'abrus\' grain, by men be wrought,
Though like a hill their high estate, they sink to nought.</item>
            <item>It yields no praise, nor to the land of Gods throws wide the gate:
Why follow men who scorn, and at their bidding wait?.</item>
            <item>Better \'twere said, \'He\'s perished!\' than to gain
The means to live, following in foeman\'s train.</item>
            <item>When high estate has lost its pride of honour meet,
Is life, that nurses this poor flesh, as nectar sweet?.</item>
            <item>Like the wild ox that, of its tuft bereft, will pine away,
Are those who, of their honour shorn, will quit the light of day.</item>
            <item>Who, when dishonour comes, refuse to live, their honoured memory
Will live in worship and applause of all the world for aye!.</item>
            <item>The light of life is mental energy; disgrace is his
Who says, \'I \'ill lead a happy life devoid of this.\'</item>
            <item>All men that live are one in circumstances of birth;
Diversities of works give each his special worth.</item>
            <item>The men of lofty line, whose souls are mean, are never great
The men of lowly birth, when high of soul, are not of low estate.</item>
            <item>Like single-hearted women, greatness too,
Exists while to itself is true.</item>
            <item>The man endowed with greatness true,
Rare deeds in perfect wise will do.</item>
            <item>\'As votaries of the truly great we will ourselves enroll,\'
Is thought that enters not the mind of men of little soul.</item>
            <item>Whene\'er distinction lights on some unworthy head,
Then deeds of haughty insolence are bred.</item>
            <item>Greatness humbly bends, but littleness always
Spreads out its plumes, and loads itself with praise.</item>
            <item>Greatness is absence of conceit; meanness, we deem,
Riding on car of vanity supreme.</item>
            <item>Greatness will hide a neighbour\'s shame;
Meanness his faults to all the world proclaim.</item>
            <item>All goodly things are duties to the men, they say
Who set themselves to walk in virtue\'s perfect way.</item>
            <item>The good of inward excellence they claim,
The perfect men; all other good is only good in name.</item>
            <item>Love, modesty, beneficence, benignant grace,
With truth, are pillars five of perfect virtue\'s resting-place.</item>
            <item>The type of \'penitence\' is virtuous good that nothing slays;
To speak no ill of other men is perfect virtue\'s praise.</item>
            <item>Submission is the might of men of mighty acts; the sage
With that same weapon stills his foeman\'s rage.</item>
            <item>What is perfection\'s test? The equal mind.
To bear repulse from even meaner men resigned.</item>
            <item>Of what avail is perfect goodness if it cannot do pleasing things even to those who have pained (it) ?.</item>
            <item>To soul with perfect virtue\'s strength endued,
Brings no disgrace the lack of every earthly good.</item>
            <item>Call them of perfect virtue\'s sea the shore,
Who, though the fates should fail, fail not for evermore.</item>
            <item>The mighty earth its burthen to sustain must cease,
If perfect virtue of the perfect men decrease.</item>
            <item>Who easy access give to every man, they say,
Of kindly courtesy will learn with ease the way.</item>
            <item>Benevolence and high born dignity,
These two are beaten paths of courtesy.</item>
            <item>Men are not one because their members seem alike to outward view;
Similitude of kindred quality makes likeness true.</item>
            <item>Of men of fruitful life, who kindly benefits dispense,
The world unites to praise the \'noble excellence\'.</item>
            <item>Contempt is evil though in sport. They who man\'s nature know,
E\'en in their wrath, a courteous mind will show.</item>
            <item>The world abides; for \'worthy\' men its weight sustain.
Were it not so, \'twould fall to dust again.</item>
            <item>Though sharp their wit as file, as blocks they must remain,
Whose souls are void of \'courtesy humane\'.</item>
            <item>Though men with all unfriendly acts and wrongs assail,
\'Tis uttermost disgrace in \'courtesy\' to fail.</item>
            <item>To him who knows not how to smile in kindly mirth,
Darkness in daytime broods o\'er all the vast and mighty earth.</item>
            <item>Like sweet milk soured because in filthy vessel poured,
Is ample wealth in churlish man\'s unopened coffers stored.</item>
            <item>Who fills his house with ample store, enjoying none,
Is dead. Nought with the useless heap is done.</item>
            <item>Who giving nought, opines from wealth all blessing springs,
Degraded birth that doting miser\'s folly brings.</item>
            <item>Who lust to heap up wealth, but glory hold not dear,
It burthens earth when on the stage of being they appear.</item>
            <item>Whom no one loves, when he shall pass away,
What doth he look to leave behind, I pray?.</item>
            <item>Amid accumulated millions they are poor,
Who nothing give and nought enjoy of all they store.</item>
            <item>Their ample wealth is misery to men of churlish heart,
Who nought themselves enjoy, and nought to worthy men impart.</item>
            <item>Like woman fair in lonelihood who aged grows,
Is wealth of him on needy men who nought bestows.</item>
            <item>When he whom no man loves exults in great prosperity,
\'Tis as when fruits in midmost of the town some poisonous tree.</item>
            <item>Who love abandon, self-afflict, and virtue\'s way forsake
To heap up glittering wealth, their hoards shall others take.</item>
            <item>\'Tis as when rain cloud in the heaven grows day,
When generous wealthy man endures brief poverty.</item>
            <item>To shrink abashed from evil deed is \'generous shame\';
Other is that of bright-browed one of virtuous fame.</item>
            <item>Food, clothing, and other things alike all beings own;
By sense of shame the excellence of men is known.</item>
            <item>All spirits homes of flesh as habitation claim,
And perfect virtue ever dwells with shame.</item>
            <item>And is not shame an ornament to men of dignity?
Without it step of stately pride is piteous thing to see.</item>
            <item>As home of virtuous shame by all the world the men are known,
Who feel ashamed for others, guilt as for their own.</item>
            <item>Unless the hedge of shame inviolate remain,
For men of lofty soul the earth\'s vast realms no charms retain.</item>
            <item>The men of modest soul for shame would life an offering make,
But ne\'er abandon virtuous shame for life\'s dear sake.</item>
            <item>Though know\'st no shame, while all around asha med must be:
Virtue will shrink away ashamed of thee!.</item>
            <item>\'Twill race consume if right observance fail;
\'Twill every good consume if shamelessness prevail.</item>
            <item>\'Tis as with strings a wooden puppet apes life\'s functions, when
Those void of shame within hold intercourse with men.</item>
            <item>Who says \'I\'ll do my work, nor slack my hand\',
His greatness, clothed with dignity supreme, shall stand.</item>
            <item>The manly act and knowledge full, when these combine
In deed prolonged, then lengthens out the race\'s line.</item>
            <item>\'I\'ll make my race renowned,\' if man shall say,
With vest succinct the goddess leads the way.</item>
            <item>Who labours for his race with unremitting pain,
Without a thought spontaneously, his end will gain.</item>
            <item>With blameless life who seeks to build his race\'s fame,
The world shall circle him, and kindred claim.</item>
            <item>Of virtuous manliness the world accords the praise
To him who gives his powers, the house from which he sprang to raise.</item>
            <item>The fearless hero bears the brunt amid the warrior throng;
Amid his kindred so the burthen rests upon the strong.</item>
            <item>Wait for no season, when you would your house uprear;
\'Twill perish, if you wait supine, or hold your honour dear.</item>
            <item>Is not his body vase that various sorrows fill,
Who would his household screen from every ill?.</item>
            <item>When trouble the foundation saps the house must fall,
If no strong hand be nigh to prop the tottering wall.</item>
            <item>Howe\'er they roam, the world must follow still the plougher\'s team;
Though toilsome, culture of the ground as noblest toil esteem.</item>
            <item>The ploughers are the linch-pin of the world; they bear
Them up who other works perform, too weak its toils to share.</item>
            <item>Who ploughing eat their food, they truly live:
The rest to others bend subservient, eating what they give.</item>
            <item>O\'er many a land they \'ll see their monarch reign,
Whose fields are shaded by the waving grain.</item>
            <item>They nothing ask from others, but to askers give,
Who raise with their own hands the food on which they live.</item>
            <item>For those who \'ve left what all men love no place is found,
When they with folded hands remain who till the ground.</item>
            <item>Reduce your soil to that dry state, When ounce is quarter-ounce\'s weight;
Without one handful of manure, Abundant crops you thus secure.</item>
            <item>To cast manure is better than to plough;
Weed well; to guard is more than watering now.</item>
            <item>When master from the field aloof hath stood;
Then land will sulk, like wife in angry mood.</item>
            <item>The earth, that kindly dame, will laugh to see,
Men seated idle pleading poverty.</item>
            <item>You ask what sharper pain than poverty is known;
Nothing pains more than poverty, save poverty alone.</item>
            <item>Malefactor matchless! poverty destroys
This world\'s and the next world\'s joys.</item>
            <item>Importunate desire, which poverty men name,
Destroys both old descent and goodly fame.</item>
            <item>From penury will spring, \'mid even those of noble race,
Oblivion that gives birth to words that bring disgrace.</item>
            <item>From poverty, that grievous woe,
Attendant sorrows plenteous grow.</item>
            <item>Though deepest sense, well understood, the poor man\'s words convey,
Their sense from memory of mankind will fade away.</item>
            <item>From indigence devoid of virtue\'s grace,
The mother e\'en that bare, estranged, will turn her face.</item>
            <item>And will it come today as yesterday,
The grief of want that eats my soul away?.</item>
            <item>Amid the flames sleep may men\'s eyelids close,
In poverty the eye knows no repose.</item>
            <item>Unless the destitute will utterly themselves deny,
They cause their neighbour\'s salt and vinegar to die.</item>
            <item>When those you find from whom \'tis meet to ask,- for aid apply;
Theirs is the sin, not yours, if they the gift deny.</item>
            <item>Even to ask an alms may pleasure give,
If what you ask without annoyance you receive.</item>
            <item>The men who nought deny, but know what\'s due, before their face
To stand as suppliants affords especial grace.</item>
            <item>Like giving alms, may even asking pleasant seem,
From men who of denial never even dream.</item>
            <item>Because on earth the men exist, who never say them nay,
Men bear to stand before their eyes for help to pray.</item>
            <item>It those you find from evil of \'denial\' free,
At once all plague of poverty will flee.</item>
            <item>If men are found who give and no harsh words of scorn employ,
The minds of askers, through and through, will thrill with joy.</item>
            <item>If askers cease, the mighty earth, where cooling fountains flow,
Will be a stage where wooden puppets come and go.</item>
            <item>What glory will there be to men of generous soul,
When none are found to love the askers\' role?.</item>
            <item>Askers refused from wrath must stand aloof;
The plague of poverty itself is ample proof.</item>
            <item>Ten million-fold \'tis greater gain, asking no alms to live,
Even from those, like eyes in worth, who nought concealing gladly give.</item>
            <item>If he that shaped the world desires that men should begging go,
Through life\'s long course, let him a wanderer be and perish so.</item>
            <item>Nothing is harder than the hardness that will say,
\'The plague of penury by asking alms we\'ll drive away\'.</item>
            <item>Who ne\'er consent to beg in utmost need, their worth
Has excellence of greatness that transcends the earth.</item>
            <item>Nothing is sweeter than to taste the toil-won cheer,
Though mess of pottage as tasteless as the water clear.</item>
            <item>E\'en if a draught of water for a cow you ask,
Nought\'s so distasteful to the tongue as beggar\'s task.</item>
            <item>One thing I beg of beggars all, \'If beg ye may,
Of those who hide their wealth, beg not, I pray\'.</item>
            <item>The fragile bark of beggary
Wrecked on denial\'s rock will lie.</item>
            <item>The heart will melt away at thought of beggary,
With thought of stern repulse \'twill perish utterly.</item>
            <item>E\'en as he asks, the shamefaced asker dies;
Where shall his spirit hide who help denies? .</item>
            <item>The base resemble men in outward form, I ween;
But counterpart exact to them I\'ve never seen.</item>
            <item>Than those of grateful heart the base must luckier be,
Their minds from every anxious thought are free!.</item>
            <item>The base are as the Gods; they too
Do ever what they list to do!.</item>
            <item>When base men those behold of conduct vile,
They straight surpass them, and exulting smile.</item>
            <item>Fear is the base man\'s virtue; if that fail,
Intense desire some little may avail.</item>
            <item>The base are like the beaten drum; for, when they hear
The sound the secret out in every neighbour\'s ear.</item>
            <item>From off their moistened hands no clinging grain they shake,
Unless to those with clenched fist their jaws who break.</item>
            <item>The good to those will profit yield fair words who use;
The base, like sugar-cane, will profit those who bruise.</item>
            <item>If neighbours clothed and fed he see, the base
Is mighty man some hidden fault to trace?.</item>
            <item>For what is base man fit, if griefs assail?
Himself to offer, there and then, for sale!.</item>
            <item>Goddess? or peafowl rare? She whose ears rich jewels wear,
Is she a maid of human kind? All wildered is my mind!.</item>
            <item>She of the beaming eyes, To my rash look her glance replies,
As if the matchless goddess\' hand Led forth an armed band.</item>
            <item>Death\'s form I formerly Knew not; but now \'tis plain to me;
He comes in lovely maiden\'s guise, With soul-subduing eyes.</item>
            <item>In sweet simplicity, A woman\'s gracious form hath she;
But yet those eyes, that drink my life, Are with the form at strife!.</item>
            <item>The light that on me gleams, Is it death\'s dart? or eye\'s bright beams?
Or fawn\'s shy glance? All three appear In form of maiden here.</item>
            <item>If cruel eye-brow\'s bow, Unbent, would veil those glances now;
The shafts that wound this trembling heart Her eyes no more would dart.</item>
            <item>As veil o\'er angry eyes Of raging elephant that lies,
The silken cincture\'s folds invest This maiden\'s panting breast.</item>
            <item>Ah! woe is me! my might, That awed my foemen in the fight,
By lustre of that beaming brow Borne down, lies broken now!.</item>
            <item>Like tender fawn\'s her eye; Clothed on is she with modesty;
What added beauty can be lent; By alien ornament?.</item>
            <item>The palm-tree\'s fragrant wine, To those who taste yields joys divine;
But love hath rare felicity For those that only see!.</item>
            <item>A double witchery have glances of her liquid eye;
One glance is glance that brings me pain; the other heals again.</item>
            <item>The furtive glance, that gleams one instant bright,
Is more than half of love\'s supreme delight.</item>
            <item>She looked, and looking drooped her head:
On springing shoot of love \'its water shed! .</item>
            <item>I look on her: her eyes are on the ground the while:
I look away: she looks on me with timid smile.</item>
            <item>She seemed to see me not; but yet the maid
Her love, by smiling side-long glance, betrayed.</item>
            <item>Though with their lips affection they disown,
Yet, when they hate us not, \'tis quickly known.</item>
            <item>The slighting words that anger feign, while eyes their love reveal.
Are signs of those that love, but would their love conceal.</item>
            <item>I gaze, the tender maid relents the while;
And, oh the matchless grace of that soft smile!.</item>
            <item>The look indifferent, that would its love disguise,
Is only read aright by lovers\' eyes.</item>
            <item>When eye to answering eye reveals the tale of love,
All words that lips can say must useless prove.</item>
            <item>All joys that senses five- sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch- can give,
In this resplendent armlets-bearing damsel live! .</item>
            <item>Disease and medicine antagonists we surely see;
This maid, to pain she gives, herself is remedy.</item>
            <item>Than rest in her soft arms to whom the soul is giv\'n,
Is any sweeter joy in his, the Lotus-eyed-one\'s heaven?</item>
            <item>Withdraw, it burns; approach, it soothes the pain;
Whence did the maid this wondrous fire obtain?.</item>
            <item>In her embrace, whose locks with flowery wreaths are bound,
Each varied form of joy the soul can wish is found.</item>
            <item>Ambrosia are the simple maiden\'s arms; when I attain
Their touch, my withered life puts forth its buds again!.</item>
            <item>As when one eats from household store, with kindly grace
Sharing his meal: such is this golden maid\'s embrace.</item>
            <item>Sweet is the strict embrace of those whom fond affection binds,
Where no dissevering breath of discord entrance finds.</item>
            <item>The jealous variance, the healing of the strife, reunion gained:
These are the fruits from wedded love obtained.</item>
            <item>The more men learn, the more their lack of learning they detect;
\'Tis so when I approach the maid with gleaming jewels decked.</item>
            <item>O flower of the sensitive plant! than thee
More tender\'s the maiden beloved by me.</item>
            <item>You deemed, as you saw the flowers, her eyes were as flowers, my soul,
That many may see; it was surely some folly that over you stole!.</item>
            <item>As tender shoot her frame; teeth, pearls; around her odours blend;
Darts are the eyes of her whose shoulders like the bambu bend.</item>
            <item>The lotus, seeing her, with head demiss, the ground would eye,
And say, \'With eyes of her, rich gems who wears, we cannot vie\'.</item>
            <item>The flowers of the sensitive plant as a girdle around her she placed;
The stems she forgot to nip off; they \'ll weigh down the delicate waist.</item>
            <item>The stars perplexed are rushing wildly from their spheres;
For like another moon this maiden\'s face appears.</item>
            <item>In moon, that waxing waning shines, as sports appear,
Are any spots discerned in face of maiden here?.</item>
            <item>Farewell, O moon! If that thine orb could shine
Bright as her face, thou shouldst be love of mine.</item>
            <item>If as her face, whose eyes are flowers, thou wouldst have charms for me,
Shine for my eyes alone, O moon, shine not for all to see!.</item>
            <item>The flower of the sensitive plant, and the down on the swan\'s white breast,
As the thorn are harsh, by the delicate feet of this maiden pressed.</item>
            <item>The dew on her white teeth, whose voice is soft and low,
Is as when milk and honey mingled flow.</item>
            <item>Between this maid and me the friendship kind
Is as the bonds that soul and body bind.</item>
            <item>For her with beauteous brow, the maid I love, there place is none;
To give her image room, O pupil of mine eye, begone! .</item>
            <item>Life is she to my very soul when she draws nigh;
Dissevered from the maid with jewels rare, I die!.</item>
            <item>I might recall, if I could once forget; but from my heart
Her charms fade not, whose eyes gleam like the warrior\'s dart.</item>
            <item>My loved one\'s subtle form departs not from my eyes;
I wink them not, lest I should pain him where he lies.</item>
            <item>My love doth ever in my eyes reside;
I stain them not, fearing his form to hide.</item>
            <item>Within my heart my lover dwells; from food I turn
That smacks of heat, lest he should feel it burn.</item>
            <item>I fear his form to hide, nor close my eyes:
\'Her love estranged is gone!\' the village cries.</item>
            <item>Rejoicing in my very soul he ever lies;
\'Her love estranged is gone far off!\' the village cries.</item>
            <item>To those who \'ve proved love\'s joy, and now afflicted mourn,
Except the helpful \'horse of palm\', no other strength remains.</item>
            <item>My body and my soul, that can no more endure,
Will lay reserve aside, and mount the \'horse of palm\'.</item>
            <item>I once retained reserve and seemly manliness;
To-day I nought possess but lovers\' \'horse of palm\'.</item>
            <item>Love\'s rushing tide will sweep away the raft
Of seemly manliness and shame combined.</item>
            <item>The maid that slender armlets wears, like flowers entwined,
Has brought me \'horse of palm,\' and pangs of eventide!.</item>
            <item>Of climbing \'horse of palm\' in midnight hour, I think;
My eyes know no repose for that same simple maid.</item>
            <item>There\'s nought of greater worth than woman\'s long-enduring soul,
Who, vexed by love like ocean waves, climbs not the \'horse of palm\'.</item>
            <item>In virtue hard to move, yet very tender, too, are we;
Love deems not so, would rend the veil, and court publicity!.</item>
            <item>\'There\'s no one knows my heart,\' so says my love,
And thus, in public ways, perturbed will rove.</item>
            <item>Before my eyes the foolish make a mock of me,
Because they ne\'er endured the pangs I now must drie.</item>
            <item>By this same rumour\'s rise, my precious life stands fast;
Good fortune grant the many know this not!.</item>
            <item>The village hath to us this rumour giv\'n, that makes her mine;
Unweeting all the rareness of the maid with flower-like eyne.</item>
            <item>The rumour spread within the town, is it not gain to me?
It is as though that were obtained that may not be.</item>
            <item>The rumour rising makes my love to rise;
My love would lose its power and languish otherwise.</item>
            <item>The more man drinks, the more he ever drunk would be;
The more my love\'s revealed, the sweeter \'tis to me! .</item>
            <item>I saw him but one single day: rumour spreads soon
As darkness, when the dragon seizes on the moon.</item>
            <item>My anguish grows apace: the town\'s report
Manures it; my mother\'s word doth water it.</item>
            <item>With butter-oil extinguish fire! \'Twill prove
Harder by scandal to extinguish love.</item>
            <item>When he who said \'Fear not!\' hath left me blamed,
While many shrink, can I from rumour hide ashamed?.</item>
            <item>If we desire, who loves will grant what we require;
This town sends forth the rumour we desire!.</item>
            <item>If you will say, \'I leave thee not,\' then tell me so;
Of quick return tell those that can survive this woe.</item>
            <item>It once was perfect joy to look upon his face;
But now the fear of parting saddens each embrace.</item>
            <item>To trust henceforth is hard, if ever he depart,
E\'en he, who knows his promise and my breaking heart.</item>
            <item>If he depart, who fondly said, \'Fear not,\' what blame\'s incurred
By those who trusted to his reassuring word?.</item>
            <item>If you would guard my life, from going him restrain
Who fills my life! If he depart, hardly we meet again.</item>
            <item>To cherish longing hope that he should ever gracious be,
Is hard, when he could stand, and of departure speak to me.</item>
            <item>The bracelet slipping from my wrist announced before
Departure of the Prince that rules the ocean shore.</item>
            <item>\'Tis sad to sojourn in the town where no kind kinsmen dwell;
\'Tis sadder still to bid a friend beloved farewell.</item>
            <item>Fire burns the hands that touch; but smart of love
Will burn in hearts that far away remove.</item>
            <item>Sorrow\'s sadness meek sustaining, Driving sore distress away,
Separation uncomplaining Many bear the livelong day!.</item>
            <item>I would my pain conceal, but see! it surging swells,
As streams to those that draw from ever-springing wells.</item>
            <item>I cannot hide this pain of mine, yet shame restrains
When I would tell it out to him who caused my pains.</item>
            <item>My soul, like porter\'s pole, within my wearied frame,
Sustains a two-fold burthen poised, of love and shame.</item>
            <item>A sea of love, \'tis true, I see stretched out before,
But not the trusty bark that wafts to yonder shore.</item>
            <item>Who work us woe in friendship\'s trustful hour,
What will they prove when angry tempests lower?.</item>
            <item>A happy love \'s sea of joy; but mightier sorrows roll
From unpropitious love athwart the troubled soul.</item>
            <item>I swim the cruel tide of love, and can no shore descry,
In watches of the night, too, \'mid the waters, only I!.</item>
            <item>All living souls in slumber soft she steeps;
But me alone kind night for her companing keeps!.</item>
            <item>More cruel than the cruelty of him, the cruel one,
In these sad times are lengthening hours of night I watch alone.</item>
            <item>When eye of mine would as my soul go forth to him,
It knows not how through floods of its own tears to swim.</item>
            <item>They showed me him, and then my endless pain
I saw: why then should weeping eyes complain?.</item>
            <item>How glancing eyes, that rash unweeting looked that day,
With sorrow measureless are wasting now away!.</item>
            <item>The eyes that threw such eager glances round erewhile
Are weeping now. Such folly surely claims a smile!.</item>
            <item>Those eyes have wept till all the fount of tears is dry,
That brought upon me pain that knows no remedy.</item>
            <item>The eye that wrought me more than sea could hold of woes,
Is suffering pangs that banish all repose.</item>
            <item>Oho! how sweet a thing to see! the eye
That wrought this pain, in the same gulf doth lie.</item>
            <item>Aching, aching, let those exhaust their stream,
That melting, melting, that day gazed on him.</item>
            <item>Who loved me once, onloving now doth here remain;
Not seeing him, my eye no rest can gain.</item>
            <item>When he comes not, all slumber flies; no sleep when he is there;
Thus every way my eyes have troubles hard to bear.</item>
            <item>It is not hard for all the town the knowledge to obtain,
When eyes, as mine, like beaten tambours, make the mystery plain.</item>
            <item>I willed my lover absent should remain;
Of pining\'s sickly hue to whom shall I complain?.</item>
            <item>\'He gave\': this sickly hue thus proudly speaks,
Then climbs, and all my frame its chariot makes.</item>
            <item>Of comeliness and shame he me bereft,
While pain and sickly hue, in recompense, he left.</item>
            <item>I meditate his words, his worth is theme of all I say,
This sickly hue is false that would my trust betray.</item>
            <item>My lover there went forth to roam;
This pallor of my frame usurps his place at home.</item>
            <item>As darkness waits till lamp expires, to fill the place,
This pallor waits till I enjoy no more my lord\'s embrace.</item>
            <item>I lay in his embrace, I turned unwittingly;
Forthwith this hue, as you might grasp it, came on me.</item>
            <item>On me, because I pine, they cast a slur;
But no one says, \'He first deserted her.\'.</item>
            <item>Well! let my frame, as now, be sicklied o\'er with pain,
If he who won my heart\'s consent, in good estate remain!.</item>
            <item>\'Tis well, though men deride me for my sickly hue of pain;
If they from calling him unkind, who won my love, refrain.</item>
            <item>The bliss to be beloved by those they love who gains,
Of love the stoneless, luscious fruit obtains.</item>
            <item>As heaven on living men showers blessings from above,
Is tender grace by lovers shown to those they love.</item>
            <item>Who love and are beloved to them alone
Belongs the boast, \'We\'ve made life\'s very joys our own.\'.</item>
            <item>Those well-beloved will luckless prove,
Unless beloved by those they love.</item>
            <item>From him I love to me what gain can be,
Unless, as I love him, he loveth me?.</item>
            <item>Love on one side is bad; like balanced load
By porter borne, love on both sides is good.</item>
            <item>While Kaman rushes straight at me alone,
Is all my pain and wasting grief unknown?</item>
            <item>Who hear from lover\'s lips no pleasant word from day to day,
Yet in the world live out their life,- no braver souls than they!.</item>
            <item>Though he my heart desires no grace accords to me,
Yet every accent of his voice is melody.</item>
            <item>Tell him thy pain that loves not thee?
Farewell, my soul, fill up the sea!.</item>
            <item>From thought of her unfailing gladness springs,
Sweeter than palm-rice wine the joy love brings.</item>
            <item>How great is love! Behold its sweetness past belief!
Think on the lover, and the spirit knows no grief.</item>
            <item>A fit of sneezing threatened, but it passed away;
He seemed to think of me, but do his fancies stray?</item>
            <item>Have I a place within his heart!
From mine, alas! he never doth depart.</item>
            <item>Me from his heart he jealously excludes:
Hath he no shame who ceaseless on my heart intrudes?.</item>
            <item>How live I yet? I live to ponder o\'er
The days of bliss with him that are no more.</item>
            <item>If I remembered not what were I then? And yet,
The fiery smart of what my spirit knows not to forget!.</item>
            <item>My frequent thought no wrath excites. It is not so?
This honour doth my love on me bestow.</item>
            <item>Dear life departs, when his ungracious deeds I ponder o\'er,
Who said erewhile, \'We\'re one for evermore\'.</item>
            <item>Set not; so may\'st thou prosper, moon! that eyes may see
My love who went away, but ever bides with me.</item>
            <item>It came and brought to me, that nightly vision rare,
A message from my love,- what feast shall I prepare?.</item>
            <item>If my dark, carp-like eye will close in sleep, as I implore,
The tale of my long-suffering life I\'ll tell my loved one o\'er.</item>
            <item>Him, who in waking hour no kindness shows,
In dreams I see; and so my lifetime goes!.</item>
            <item>Some pleasure I enjoy when him who loves not me
In waking hours, the vision searches out and makes me see.</item>
            <item>As what I then beheld in waking hour was sweet,
So pleasant dreams in hour of sleep my spirit greet.</item>
            <item>And if there were no waking hour, my love
In dreams would never from my side remove.</item>
            <item>The cruel one, in waking hour, who all ungracious seems,
Why should he thus torment my soul in nightly dreams?.</item>
            <item>And when I sleep he holds my form embraced;
And when I wake to fill my heart makes haste!.</item>
            <item>In dreams who ne\'er their lover\'s form perceive,
For those in waking hours who show no love will grieve.</item>
            <item>They say, that he in waking hours has left me lone;
In dreams they surely see him not,- these people of the town.</item>
            <item>Thou art not evening, but a spear that doth devour
The souls of brides; farewell, thou evening hour!.</item>
            <item>Thine eye is sad; Hail, doubtful hour of eventide!
Of cruel eye, as is my spouse, is too thy bride?.</item>
            <item>With buds of chilly dew wan evening\'s shade enclose;
My anguish buds space and all my sorrow grows.</item>
            <item>When absent is my love, the evening hour descends,
As when an alien host to field of battle wends.</item>
            <item>O morn, how have I won thy grace? thou bring\'st relief
O eve, why art thou foe! thou dost renew my grief.</item>
            <item>The pangs that evening brings I never knew,
Till he, my wedded spouse, from me withdrew.</item>
            <item>My grief at morn a bud, all day an opening flower,
Full-blown expands in evening hour.</item>
            <item>The shepherd\'s pipe is like a murderous weapon, to my ear,
For it proclaims the hour of ev\'ning\'s fiery anguish near.</item>
            <item>If evening\'s shades, that darken all my soul, extend;
From this afflicted town will would of grief ascend.</item>
            <item>This darkening eve, my darkling soul must perish utterly;
Remembering him who seeks for wealth, but seeks not me.</item>
            <item>Thine eyes grown dim are now ashamed the fragrant flow\'rs to see,
Thinking on him, who wand\'ring far, leaves us in misery.</item>
            <item>The eye, with sorrow wan, all wet with dew of tears,
As witness of the lover\'s lack of love appears.</item>
            <item>These withered arms, desertion\'s pangs abundantly display,
That swelled with joy on that glad nuptial day.</item>
            <item>When lover went, then faded all their wonted charms,
And armlets\' golden round slips off from these poor wasted arms.</item>
            <item>These wasted arms, the bracelet with their wonted beauty gone,
The cruelty declare of that most cruel one.</item>
            <item>grieve, \'tis pain to me to hear him cruel chid,
Because the armlet from my wasted arm has slid.</item>
            <item>My heart! say ought of glory wilt thou gain,
If to that cruel one thou of thy wasted arms complain?.</item>
            <item>One day the fervent pressure of embracing arms I checked,
Grew wan the forehead of the maid with golden armlet decked.</item>
            <item>As we embraced a breath of wind found entrance there;
The maid\'s large liquid eyes were dimmed with care.</item>
            <item>The dimness of her eye felt sorrow now,
Beholding what was done by that bright brow.</item>
            <item>My heart, canst thou not thinking of some med\'cine tell,
Not any one, to drive away this grief incurable?.</item>
            <item>Since he loves not, thy smart
Is folly, fare thee well my heart!.</item>
            <item>What comes of sitting here in pining thought, O heart? He knows
No pitying thought, the cause of all these wasting woes.</item>
            <item>O rid me of these eyes, my heart; for they,
Longing to see him, wear my life away.</item>
            <item>O heart, as a foe, can I abandon utterly
Him who, though I long for him, longs not for me?.</item>
            <item>My heart, false is the fire that burns; thou canst not wrath maintain,
If thou thy love behold, embracing, soothing all thy pain.</item>
            <item>Or bid thy love, or bid thy shame depart;
For me, I cannot bear them both, my worthy heart!.</item>
            <item>Thou art befooled, my heart, thou followest him who flees from thee;
And still thou yearning criest: \'He will nor pity show nor love to me.\'.</item>
            <item>My heart! my lover lives within my mind;
Roaming, whom dost thou think to find?.</item>
            <item>If I should keep in mind the man who utterly renounces me,
My soul must suffer further loss of dignity.</item>
            <item>The axe of lust can break the door of chastity which is bolted with the bolt of modesty.</item>
            <item>What men call love is the one thing of merciless power;
It gives my soul no rest, e\'en in the midnight hour.</item>
            <item>I would my love conceal, but like a sneeze
It shows itself, and gives no warning sign.</item>
            <item>In womanly reserve I deemed myself beyond assail;
But love will come abroad, and casts away the veil.</item>
            <item>The dignity that seeks not him who acts as foe,
Is the one thing that loving heart can never know.</item>
            <item>My grief how full of grace, I pray you see!
It seeks to follow him that hateth me.</item>
            <item>No sense of shame my gladdened mind shall prove,
When he returns my longing heart to bless with love.</item>
            <item>The words of that deceiver, versed in every wily art,
Are instruments that break through every guard of woman\'s heart!.</item>
            <item>\'I \'ll shun his greeting\'; saying thus with pride away I went:
I held him in my arms, for straight I felt my heart relent.</item>
            <item>\'We \'ll stand aloof and then embrace\': is this for them to say,
Whose hearts are as the fat that in the blaze dissolves away?.</item>
            <item>By My eyes have lost their brightness, sight is dimmed; my fingers worn,
With nothing on the wall the days since I was left forlorn.</item>
            <item>O thou with gleaming jewels decked, could I forget for this one day,
Henceforth these bracelets from my arms will slip, my beauty worn away.</item>
            <item>On victory intent, His mind sole company he went;
And I yet life sustain! And long to see his face again!.</item>
            <item>\'He comes again, who left my side, and I shall taste love\'s joy,\'-
My heart with rapture swells, when thoughts like these my mind employ.</item>
            <item>O let me see my spouse again and sate these longing eyes!
That instant from my wasted frame all pallor flies.</item>
            <item>O let my spouse but come again to me one day!
I\'ll drink that nectar: wasting grief shall flee away.</item>
            <item>On the return of him who is as dear as my eyes, am I displeased or am I to embrace (him); or am I to do both?.</item>
            <item>O would my king would fight, o\'ercome, devide the spoil;
At home, to-night, the banquet spread should crown the toil.</item>
            <item>One day will seem like seven to those who watch and yearn
For that glad day when wanderers from afar return.</item>
            <item>What\'s my return, the meeting hour, the wished-for greeting worth,
If she heart-broken lie, with all her life poured forth?.</item>
            <item>Thou hid\'st it, yet thine eye, disdaining all restraint,
Something, I know not, what, would utter of complaint.</item>
            <item>The simple one whose beauty fills mine eye, whose shoulders curve
Like bambu stem, hath all a woman\'s modest sweet reserve.</item>
            <item>As through the crystal beads is seen the thread on which they \'re strung
So in her beauty gleams some thought cannot find a tongue.</item>
            <item>As fragrance in the opening bud, some secret lies
Concealed in budding smile of this dear damsel\'s eyes.</item>
            <item>The secret wiles of her with thronging armlets decked,
Are medicines by which my raising grief is checked.</item>
            <item>While lovingly embracing me, his heart is only grieved:
It makes me think that I again shall live of love bereaved.</item>
            <item>My severance from the lord of this cool shore,
My very armlets told me long before.</item>
            <item>My loved one left me, was it yesterday?
Days seven my pallid body wastes away!.</item>
            <item>She viewed her tender arms, she viewed the armlets from them slid;
She viewed her feet: all this the lady did.</item>
            <item>To show by eye the pain of love, and for relief to pray,
Is womanhood\'s most womanly device, men say.</item>
            <item>Gladness at the thought, rejoicing at the sight,
Not palm-tree wine, but love, yields such delight.</item>
            <item>When as palmyra tall, fulness of perfect love we gain,
Distrust can find no place small as the millet grain.</item>
            <item>Although his will his only law, he lightly value me,
My heart knows no repose unless my lord I see.</item>
            <item>My friend, I went prepared to show a cool disdain;
My heart, forgetting all, could not its love restrain.</item>
            <item>The eye sees not the rod that paints it; nor can I
See any fault, when I behold my husband nigh.</item>
            <item>When him I see, to all his faults I \'m blind;
But when I see him not, nothing but faults I find.</item>
            <item>As those of rescue sure, who plunge into the stream,
So did I anger feign, though it must falsehood seem?.</item>
            <item>Though shameful ill it works, dear is the palm-tree wine
To drunkards; traitor, so to me that breast of thine!.</item>
            <item>Love is tender as an opening flower. In season due
To gain its perfect bliss is rapture known to few.</item>
            <item>Her eye, as I drew nigh one day, with anger shone:
By love o\'erpowered, her tenderness surpassed my own.</item>
            <item>You see his heart is his alone
O heart, why not be all my own?.</item>
            <item>\'Tis plain, my heart, that he \'s estranged from thee;
Why go to him as though he were not enemy?.</item>
            <item>\'The ruined have no friends, \'they say; and so, my heart,
To follow him, at thy desire, from me thou dost depart.</item>
            <item>\'See, thou first show offended pride, and then submit,\' I bade;
Henceforth such council who will share with thee my heart?.</item>
            <item>I fear I shall not gain, I fear to lose him when I gain;
And thus my heart endures unceasing pain.</item>
            <item>My heart consumes me when I ponder lone,
And all my lover\'s cruelty bemoan.</item>
            <item>Fall\'n \'neath the sway of this ignoble foolish heart,
Which will not him forget, I have forgotten shame.</item>
            <item>If I contemn him, then disgrace awaits me evermore;
My soul that seeks to live his virtues numbers o\'er.</item>
            <item>And who will aid me in my hour of grief,
If my own heart comes not to my relief?.</item>
            <item>A trifle is unfriendliness by aliens shown,
When our own heart itself is not our own!.</item>
            <item>Be still reserved, decline his profferred love;
A little while his sore distress we \'ll prove.</item>
            <item>A cool reserve is like the salt that seasons well the mess,
Too long maintained, \'tis like the salt\'s excess.</item>
            <item>\'Tis heaping griefs on those whose hearts are grieved;
To leave the grieving one without a fond embrace.</item>
            <item>To use no kind conciliating art when lover grieves,
Is cutting out the root of tender winding plant that droops.</item>
            <item>The Even to men of good and worthy mind, the petulance
Of wives with flowery eyes lacks not a lovely grace.</item>
            <item>Love without hatred is ripened fruit;
Without some lesser strife, fruit immature.</item>
            <item>A lovers\' quarrel brings its pain, when mind afraid
Asks doubtful, \'Will reunion sweet be long delayed?\'.</item>
            <item>What good can grieving do, when none who love
Are there to know the grief thy soul endures?.</item>
            <item>Water is pleasant in the cooling shade;
So coolness for a time with those we love.</item>
            <item>Of her who leaves me thus in variance languishing,
To think within my heart with love is fond desire.</item>
            <item>From thy regard all womankind Enjoys an equal grace;
O thou of wandering fickle mind, I shrink from thine embrace.</item>
            <item>One day we silent sulked; he sneezed: The reason well I knew;
He thought that I, to speak well pleased, Would say, \'Long life to you!\'.</item>
            <item>I wreathed with flowers one day my brow, The angry tempest lowers;
She cries, \'Pray, for what woman now Do you put on your flowers?\'.</item>
            <item>\'I love you more than all beside,\' \'T was thus I gently spoke;
\'What all, what all?\' she instant cried; And all her anger woke.</item>
            <item>\'While here I live, I leave you not,\' I said to calm her fears.
She cried, \'There, then, I read your thought\'; And straight dissolved in tears.</item>
            <item>\'Each day I called to mind your charms,\' \'O, then, you had forgot,\'
She cried, and then her opened arms, Forthwith embraced me not.</item>
            <item>She hailed me when I sneezed one day; But straight with anger seized,
She cried; \'Who was the woman, pray, Thinking of whom you sneezed?\'.</item>
            <item>And so next time I checked my sneeze; She forthwith wept and cried,
(That woman difficult to please), \'Your thoughts from me you hide\'.</item>
            <item>I then began to soothe and coax, To calm her jealous mind;
\'I see\', quoth she, \'to other folks How you are wondrous kind\' .</item>
            <item>I silent sat, but thought the more, And gazed on her. Then she
Cried out, \'While thus you eye me o\'er, Tell me whose form you see\'.</item>
            <item>Although there be no fault in him, the sweetness of his love
Hath power in me a fretful jealousy to move.</item>
            <item>My \'anger feigned\' gives but a little pain;
And when affection droops, it makes it bloom again.</item>
            <item>Is there a bliss in any world more utterly divine,
Than \'coyness\' gives, when hearts as earth and water join?.</item>
            <item>\'Within the anger feigned\' that close love\'s tie doth bind,
A weapon lurks, which quite breaks down my mind.</item>
            <item>Though free from fault, from loved one\'s tender arms
To be estranged a while hath its own special charms.</item>
            <item>\'Tis sweeter to digest your food than \'tis to eat;
In love, than union\'s self is anger feigned more sweet.</item>
            <item>In lovers\' quarrels, \'tis the one that first gives way,
That in re-union\'s joy is seen to win the day.</item>
            <item>And shall we ever more the sweetness know of that embrace
With dewy brow; to which \'feigned anger\' lent its piquant grace.</item>
            <item>Let her, whose jewels brightly shine, aversion feign!
That I may still plead on, O night, prolong thy reign!.</item>
            <item>A \'feigned aversion\' coy to pleasure gives a zest;
The pleasure\'s crowned when breast is clasped to breast.</item>
